&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need for ancillary activities to constitute a minority of activities at a group level;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of their trading activity compared to the overall market trading activity in that asset class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;In determining the extent to which ancillary activities constitute a minority of activities at a group level ESMA may determine that the capital employed for carrying out the ancillary activity relative to the capital employed for carrying out the main business is to be considered.

In that regard, the competent authorities shall communicate to each other upon request all relevant information and shall communicate on their own initiative all essential information. A decision by the competent authority that has authorised the investment firm in which the acquisition is proposed shall indicate any views or reservations expressed by the competent authority responsible for the proposed acquirer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that, if an investment firm becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposals of holdings in its capital that cause holdings to exceed or fall below any of the thresholds referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, that investment firm is to inform the competent authority without delay.&lt;br&gt;At least once a year, investment firms shall also inform the competent authority of the names of shareholders and members possessing qualifying holdings and the sizes of such holdings as shown, for example, by the information received at annual general meetings of shareholders and members or as a result of compliance with the regulations applicable to companies whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that competent authorities take measures similar to those referred to in Article 10(3) in respect of persons who fail to comply with the obligation to provide prior information in relation to the acquisition or increase of a qualifying holding.

&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities may, during the assessment period, if necessary, and no later than on the 50th working day of the assessment period, request any further information that is necessary to complete the assessment. Such request shall be made in writing and shall specify the additional information needed.&lt;br&gt;For the period between the date of request for information by the competent authorities and the receipt of a response thereto by the proposed acquirer, the assessment period shall be interrupted. The interruption shall not exceed 20 working days. Any further requests by the competent authorities for completion or clarification of the information shall be at their discretion but may not result in an interruption of the assessment period.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If the competent authorities, upon completion of the assessment, decide to oppose the proposed acquisition, they shall, within two working days, and not exceeding the assessment period, inform the proposed acquirer in writing and provide the reasons for that decision. Subject to national law, an appropriate statement of the reasons for the decision may be made accessible to the public at the request of the proposed acquirer. This shall not prevent a Member State from allowing the competent authority to make such disclosure in the absence of a request by the proposed acquirer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the competent authorities do not oppose the proposed acquisition within the assessment period in writing, it shall be deemed to be approved.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reputation of the proposed acquirer;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the financial soundness of the proposed acquirer, in particular in relation to the type of business pursued and envisaged in the investment firm in which the acquisition is proposed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the investment firm will be able to comply and continue to comply with the prudential requirements based on this Directive and, where applicable, other Directives, in particular Directives 2002/87/EC and 2013/36/EU, in particular, whether the group of which it will become a part has a structure that makes it possible to exercise effective supervision, effectively exchange information among the competent authorities and determine the allocation of responsibilities among the competent authorities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that, in connection with the proposed acquisition, money laundering or terrorist financing within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 2005/60/EC is being or has been committed or attempted, or that the proposed acquisition could increase the risk thereof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 which adjust the criteria set out in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities may oppose the proposed acquisition only if there are reasonable grounds for doing so on the basis of the criteria set out in paragraph 1 or if the information provided by the proposed acquirer is incomplete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall neither impose any prior conditions in respect of the level of holding that must be acquired nor allow their competent authorities to examine the proposed acquisition in terms of the economic needs of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall make publicly available a list specifying the information that is necessary to carry out the assessment and that must be provided to the competent authorities at the time of notification referred to in Article 11(1). The information required shall be proportionate and adapted to the nature of the proposed acquirer and the proposed acquisition. Member States shall not require information that is not relevant for a prudential assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding Article 12(1), (2) and (3), where two or more proposals to acquire or increase qualifying holdings in the same investment firm have been notified to the competent authority, the latter shall treat the proposed acquirers in a non-discriminatory manner.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that investment firms and market operators operating an MTF, in addition to meeting the requirements laid down in Articles 16 and 18, shall establish and implement non-discretionary rules for the execution of orders in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that the rules referred to in Article 18(3) governing access to an MTF comply with the conditions established in Article 53(3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall require that investment firms and market operators operating an MTF to have arrangements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be adequately equipped to manage the risks to which it is exposed, to implement appropriate arrangements and systems to identify all significant risks to its operation, and to put in place effective measures to mitigate those risks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to have effective arrangements to facilitate the efficient and timely finalisation of the transactions executed under its systems; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to have available, at the time of authorisation and on an ongoing basis, sufficient financial resources to facilitate its orderly functioning, having regard to the nature and extent of the transactions concluded on the market and the range and degree of the risks to which it is exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that Articles 24, 25, Article 27(1), (2) and (4) to (10) and Article 28 are not applicable to the transactions concluded under the rules governing an MTF between its members or participants or between the MTF and its members or participants in relation to the use of the MTF. However, the members of or participants in the MTF shall comply with the obligations provided for in Articles 24, 25, 27 and 28 with respect to their clients when, acting on behalf of their clients, they execute their orders through the systems of an MTF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall not allow investment firms or market operators operating an MTF to execute client orders against proprietary capital, or to engage in matched principal trading.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that an investment firm and a market operator operating an OTF establishes arrangements preventing the execution of client orders in an OTF against the proprietary capital of the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF or from any entity that is part of the same group or legal person as the investment firm or market operator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall permit an investment firm or market operator operating an OTF to engage in matched principal trading in bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and certain derivatives only where the client has consented to the process.&lt;br&gt;An investment firm or market operator operating an OTF shall not use matched principal trading to execute client orders in an OTF in derivatives pertaining to a class of derivatives that has been declared subject to the clearing obligation in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.&lt;br&gt;An investment firm or market operator operating an OTF shall establish arrangements ensuring compliance with the definition of matched principal trading in point (38) of Article 4(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall permit an investment firm or market operator operating an OTF to engage in dealing on own account other than matched principal trading only with regard to sovereign debt instruments for which there is not a liquid market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall not allow the operation of an OTF and of a systematic internaliser to take place within the same legal entity. An OTF shall not connect with a systematic internaliser in a way which enables orders in an OTF and orders or quotes in a systematic internaliser to interact. An OTF shall not connect with another OTF in a way which enables orders in different OTFs to interact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall not prevent an investment firm or a market operator operating an OTF from engaging another investment firm to carry out market making on that OTF on an independent basis.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this Article, an investment firm shall not be deemed to be carrying out market making on an OTF on an independent basis if it has close links with the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that the execution of orders on an OTF is carried out on a discretionary basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment firm or market operator operating an OTF shall exercise discretion only in either or both of the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when deciding to place or retract an order on the OTF they operate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when deciding not to match a specific client order with other orders available in the systems at a given time, provided it is in compliance with specific instructions received from a client and with its obligations in accordance with Article 27.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the system that crosses client orders the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF may decide if, when and how much of two or more orders it wants to match within the system. In accordance with paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5 and without prejudice to paragraph 3, with regard to a system that arranges transactions in non-equities, the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF may facilitate negotiation between clients so as to bring together two or more potentially compatible trading interest in a transaction.&lt;br&gt;That obligation shall be without prejudice to Articles 18 and 27.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authority may require, either when an investment firm or market operator requests to be authorised for the operation of an OTF or on ad-hoc basis, a detailed explanation why the system does not correspond to and cannot operate as a regulated market, MTF, or systematic internaliser, a detailed description as to how discretion will be exercised, in particular when an order to the OTF may be retracted and when and how two or more client orders will be matched within the OTF. In addition, the investment firm or market operator of an OTF shall provide the competent authority with information explaining its use of matched principal trading. The competent authority shall monitor an investment firm’s or market operator’s engagement in matched principal trading to ensure that it continues to fall within the definition of such trading and that its engagement in matched principal trading does not give rise to conflicts of interest between the investment firm or market operator and its clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that Articles 24, 25, 27 and 28 are applied to the transactions concluded on an OTF.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where organisational or administrative arrangements made by the investment firm in accordance with Article 16(3) to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interest of its client are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that risks of damage to client interests will be prevented, the investment firm shall clearly disclose to the client the general nature and/or sources of conflicts of interest and the steps taken to mitigate those risks before undertaking business on its behalf.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that, when providing investment services or, where appropriate, ancillary services to clients, an investment firm act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interests of its clients and comply, in particular, with the principles set out in this Article and in Article 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment firms which manufacture financial instruments for sale to clients shall ensure that those financial instruments are designed to meet the needs of an identified target market of end clients within the relevant category of clients, the strategy for distribution of the financial instruments is compatible with the identified target market, and the investment firm takes reasonable steps to ensure that the financial instrument is distributed to the identified target market.&lt;br&gt;An investment firm shall understand the financial instruments they offer or recommend, assess the compatibility of the financial instruments with the needs of the clients to whom it provides investment services, also taking account of the identified target market of end clients as referred to in Article 16(3), and ensure that financial instruments are offered or recommended only when this is in the interest of the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All information, including marketing communications, addressed by the investment firm to clients or potential clients shall be fair, clear and not misleading. Marketing communications shall be clearly identifiable as such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appropriate information shall be provided in good time to clients or potential clients with regard to the investment firm and its services, the financial instruments and proposed investment strategies, execution venues and all costs and related charges. That information shall include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when investment advice is provided, the investment firm must, in good time before it provides investment advice, inform the client:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether or not the advice is provided on an independent basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the advice is based on a broad or on a more restricted analysis of different types of financial instruments and, in particular, whether the range is limited to financial instruments issued or provided by entities having close links with the investment firm or any other legal or economic relationships, such as contractual relationships, so close as to pose a risk of impairing the independent basis of the advice provided;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the investment firm will provide the client with a periodic assessment of the suitability of the financial instruments recommended to that client;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the information on financial instruments and proposed investment strategies must include appropriate guidance on and warnings of the risks associated with investments in those instruments or in respect of particular investment strategies and whether the financial instrument is intended for retail or professional clients, taking account of the identified target market in accordance with paragraph 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the information on all costs and associated charges must include information relating to both investment and ancillary services, including the cost of advice, where relevant, the cost of the financial instrument recommended or marketed to the client and how the client may pay for it, also encompassing any third-party payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The information about all costs and charges, including costs and charges in connection with the investment service and the financial instrument, which are not caused by the occurrence of underlying market risk, shall be aggregated to allow the client to understand the overall cost as well as the cumulative effect on return of the investment, and where the client so requests, an itemised breakdown shall be provided. Where applicable, such information shall be provided to the client on a regular basis, at least annually, during the life of the investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information referred to in paragraphs 4 and 9 shall be provided in a comprehensible form in such a manner that clients or potential clients are reasonably able to understand the nature and risks of the investment service and of the specific type of financial instrument that is being offered and, consequently, to take investment decisions on an informed basis. Member States may allow that information to be provided in a standardised format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an investment service is offered as part of a financial product which is already subject to other provisions of Union law relating to credit institutions and consumer credits with respect to information requirements, that service shall not be additionally subject to the obligations set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where an investment firm informs the client that investment advice is provided on an independent basis, that investment firm shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assess a sufficient range of financial instruments available on the market which must be sufficiently diverse with regard to their type and issuers or product providers to ensure that the client’s investment objectives can be suitably met and must not be limited to financial instruments issued or provided by:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investment firm itself or by entities having close links with the investment firm; or&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not accept and retain fees, commissions or any monetary or non-monetary benefits paid or provided by any third party or a person acting on behalf of a third party in relation to the provision of the service to clients. Minor non-monetary benefits that are capable of enhancing the quality of service provided to a client and are of a scale and nature such that they could not be judged to impair compliance with the investment firm’s duty to act in the best interest of the client must be clearly disclosed and are excluded from this point.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When providing portfolio management the investment firm shall not accept and retain fees, commissions or any monetary or non-monetary benefits paid or provided by any third party or a person acting on behalf of a third party in relation to the provision of the service to clients. Minor non-monetary benefits that are capable of enhancing the quality of service provided to a client and are of a scale and nature such that they could not be judged to impair compliance with the investment firm’s duty to act in the best interest of the client shall be clearly disclosed and are excluded from this paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that investment firms are regarded as not fulfilling their obligations under Article 23 or under paragraph 1 of this Article where they pay or are paid any fee or commission, or provide or are provided with any non-monetary benefit in connection with the provision of an investment service or an ancillary service, to or by any party except the client or a person on behalf of the client, other than where the payment or benefit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;does not impair compliance with the investment firm’s duty to act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interest of its clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The existence, nature and amount of the payment or benefit referred to in the first subparagraph, or, where the amount cannot be ascertained, the method of calculating that amount, must be clearly disclosed to the client, in a manner that is comprehensive, accurate and understandable, prior to the provision of the relevant investment or ancillary service. Where applicable, the investment firm shall also inform the client on mechanisms for transferring to the client the fee, commission, monetary or non-monetary benefit received in relation to the provision of the investment or ancillary service.&lt;br&gt;The payment or benefit which enables or is necessary for the provision of investment services, such as custody costs, settlement and exchange fees, regulatory levies or legal fees, and which by its nature cannot give rise to conflicts with the investment firm’s duties to act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interests of its clients, is not subject to the requirements set out in the first subparagraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investment firm which provides investment services to clients shall ensure that it does not remunerate or assess the performance of its staff in a way that conflicts with its duty to act in the best interests of its clients. In particular, it shall not make any arrangement by way of remuneration, sales targets or otherwise that could provide an incentive to its staff to recommend a particular financial instrument to a retail client when the investment firm could offer a different financial instrument which would better meet that client’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an investment service is offered together with another service or product as part of a package or as a condition for the same agreement or package, the investment firm shall inform the client whether it is possible to buy the different components separately and shall provide for a separate evidence of the costs and charges of each component.&lt;br&gt;Where the risks resulting from such an agreement or package offered to a retail client are likely to be different from the risks associated with the components taken separately, the investment firm shall provide an adequate description of the different components of the agreement or package and the way in which its interaction modifies the risks.&lt;br&gt;ESMA, in cooperation with EBA and EIOPA, shall develop by 3 January 2016, and update periodically, guidelines for the assessment and the supervision of cross-selling practices indicating, in particular, situations in which cross-selling practices are not compliant with obligations laid down in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may, in exceptional cases, impose additional requirements on investment firms in respect of the matters covered by this Article. Such requirements must be objectively justified and proportionate so as to address specific risks to investor protection or to market integrity which are of particular importance in the circumstances of the market structure of that Member State.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall notify the Commission of any requirement which they intend to impose in accordance with this paragraph without undue delay and at least two months before the date appointed for that requirement to come into force. The notification shall include a justification for that requirement. Any such additional requirements shall not restrict or otherwise affect the rights of investment firms under Articles 34 and 35 of this Directive.&lt;br&gt;The Commission shall within two months from the notification referred to in the second subparagraph provide its opinion on the proportionality of and justification for the additional requirements.&lt;br&gt;The Commission shall communicate to Member States and make public on its website the additional requirements imposed in accordance with this paragraph.&lt;br&gt;Member States may retain additional requirements that were notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2006/73/EC before 2 July 2014 provided that the conditions laid down in that Article are met.&lt;/li&gt;

Member States shall publish the criteria to be used for assessing such knowledge and competence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When providing investment advice or portfolio management the investment firm shall obtain the necessary information regarding the client’s or potential client’s knowledge and experience in the investment field relevant to the specific type of product or service, that person’s financial situation including his ability to bear losses, and his investment objectives including his risk tolerance so as to enable the investment firm to recommend to the client or potential client the investment services and financial instruments that are suitable for him and, in particular, are in accordance with his risk tolerance and ability to bear losses.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that where an investment firm provides investment advice recommending a package of services or products bundled pursuant to Article 24(11), the overall bundled package is suitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that investment firms, when providing investment services other than those referred to in paragraph 2, ask the client or potential client to provide information regarding that person’s knowledge and experience in the investment field relevant to the specific type of product or service offered or demanded so as to enable the investment firm to assess whether the investment service or product envisaged is appropriate for the client. Where a bundle of services or products is envisaged pursuant to Article 24(11), the assessment shall consider whether the overall bundled package is appropriate.&lt;br&gt;Where the investment firm considers, on the basis of the information received under the first subparagraph, that the product or service is not appropriate to the client or potential client, the investment firm shall warn the client or potential client. That warning may be provided in a standardised format.&lt;br&gt;Where clients or potential clients do not provide the information referred to under the first subparagraph, or where they provide insufficient information regarding their knowledge and experience, the investment firm shall warn them that the investment firm is not in a position to determine whether the service or product envisaged is appropriate for them. That warning may be provided in a standardised format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall allow investment firms when providing investment services that only consist of execution or reception and transmission of client orders with or without ancillary services, excluding the granting of credits or loans as specified in Section B.1 of Annex I that do not comprise of existing credit limits of loans, current accounts and overdraft facilities of clients, to provide those investment services to their clients without the need to obtain the information or make the determination provided for in paragraph 3 where all the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the services relate to any of the following financial instruments:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shares admitted to trading on a regulated market or on an equivalent third-country market or on a MTF, where those are shares in companies, and excluding shares in non-UCITS collective investment undertakings and shares that embed a derivative;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds or other forms of securitised debt admitted to trading on a regulated market or on an equivalent third country market or on a MTF, excluding those that embed a derivative or incorporate a structure which makes it difficult for the client to understand the risk involved;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money-market instruments, excluding those that embed a derivative or incorporate a structure which makes it difficult for the client to understand the risk involved;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shares or units in UCITS, excluding structured UCITS as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 36(1) of Regulation (EU) No 583/2010;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;structured deposits, excluding those that incorporate a structure which makes it difficult for the client to understand the risk of return or the cost of exiting the product before term;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other non-complex financial instruments for the purpose of this paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this point, a third-country market shall be considered to be equivalent to a regulated market if the requirements and the procedure laid down under the third and the fourth subparagraphs are fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of the competent authority of a Member State, the Commission shall adopt equivalence decisions in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 89a(2), stating whether the legal and supervisory framework of a third country ensures that a regulated market authorised in that third country complies with legally binding requirements which are, for the purpose of the application of this point, equivalent to the requirements resulting from Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, from Title III of this Directive, from Title II of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and from Directive 2004/109/EC, and which are subject to effective supervision and enforcement in that third country. The competent authority shall indicate why it considers that the legal and supervisory framework of the third country concerned is to be considered equivalent and shall provide relevant information to that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such third-country legal and supervisory framework may be considered equivalent where that framework fulfils at least the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the markets are subject to authorisation and to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the markets have clear and transparent rules regarding the admission of securities to trading so that such securities are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner, and are freely negotiable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security issuers are subject to periodic and ongoing information requirements ensuring a high level of investor protection; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market transparency and integrity are ensured by the prevention of market abuse in the form of insider dealing and market manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the service is provided at the initiative of the client or potential client;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the client or potential client has been clearly informed that in the provision of that service the investment firm is not required to assess the appropriateness of the financial instrument or service provided or offered and that therefore he does not benefit from the corresponding protection of the relevant conduct of business rules. Such a warning may be provided in a standardised format;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the investment firm complies with its obligations under Article 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investment firm shall establish a record that includes the document or documents agreed between the investment firm and the client that set out the rights and obligations of the parties, and the other terms on which the investment firm will provide services to the client. The rights and duties of the parties to the contract may be incorporated by reference to other documents or legal texts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investment firm shall provide the client with adequate reports on the service provided in a durable medium. Those reports shall include periodic communications to clients, taking into account the type and the complexity of financial instruments involved and the nature of the service provided to the client and shall include, where applicable, the costs associated with the transactions and services undertaken on behalf of the client.&lt;br&gt;When providing investment advice, the investment firm shall, before the transaction is made, provide the client with a statement on suitability in a durable medium specifying the advice given and how that advice meets the preferences, objectives and other characteristics of the retail client.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the agreement to buy or sell a financial instrument is concluded using a means of distance communication which prevents the prior delivery of the suitability statement, the investment firm may provide the written statement on suitability in a durable medium immediately after the client is bound by any agreement, provided both the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the client has consented to receiving the suitability statement without undue delay after the conclusion of the transaction; and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that for financial instruments subject to the trading obligation in Articles 23 and 28 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 each trading venue and systematic internaliser and for other financial instruments each execution venue makes available to the public, without any charges, data relating to the quality of execution of transactions on that venue on at least an annual basis and that following execution of a transaction on behalf of a client the investment firm shall inform the client where the order was executed.

Member States shall require that investment firms obtain the prior express consent of their clients before proceeding to execute their orders outside a trading venue. Investment firms may obtain such consent either in the form of a general agreement or in respect of individual transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require investment firms who execute client orders to summarise and make public on an annual basis, for each class of financial instruments, the top five execution venues in terms of trading volumes where they executed client orders in the preceding year and information on the quality of execution obtained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require investment firms who execute client orders to monitor the effectiveness of their order execution arrangements and execution policy in order to identify and, where appropriate, correct any deficiencies. In particular, they shall assess, on a regular basis, whether the execution venues included in the order execution policy provide for the best possible result for the client or whether they need to make changes to their execution arrangements, taking account of, inter alia, the information published under paragraphs 3 and 6. Member States shall require investment firms to notify clients with whom they have an ongoing client relationship of any material changes to their order execution arrangements or execution policy.&lt;/li&gt;

Member States may decide that investment firms comply with that obligation by transmitting the client limit order to a trading venue. Member States shall provide that the competent authorities may waive the obligation to make public a limit order that is large in scale compared with normal market size as determined under Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that where an investment firm decides to appoint a tied agent it remains fully and unconditionally responsible for any action or omission on the part of the tied agent when acting on behalf of the investment firm. Member States shall require the investment firm to ensure that a tied agent discloses the capacity in which he is acting and the investment firm which he is representing when contacting or before dealing with any client or potential client.&lt;br&gt;Member States may allow, in accordance with Article 16(6), (8) and (9), tied agents registered in their territory to hold money and/or financial instruments of clients on behalf and under the full responsibility of the investment firm for which they are acting within their territory or, in the case of a cross border operation, in the territory of a Member State which allows a tied agent to hold client money.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall require the investment firms to monitor the activities of their tied agents so as to ensure that they continue to comply with this Directive when acting through tied agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tied agents shall be registered in the public register in the Member State where they are established. ESMA shall publish on its website references or hyperlinks to the public registers established under this Article by the Member States that decide to allow investment firms to appoint tied agents.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that tied agents are only admitted to the public register if it has been established that they are of sufficiently good repute and that they possess the appropriate general, commercial and professional knowledge and competence so as to be able to deliver the investment service or ancillary service and to communicate accurately all relevant information regarding the proposed service to the client or potential client.&lt;br&gt;Member States may decide that, subject to appropriate control, investment firms can verify whether the tied agents which they have appointed are of sufficiently good repute and possess the knowledge and competence referred to in the second subparagraph.&lt;br&gt;The register shall be updated on a regular basis. It shall be publicly available for consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that investment firms appointing tied agents take adequate measures in order to avoid any negative impact that the activities of the tied agent not covered by the scope of this Directive could have on the activities carried out by the tied agent on behalf of the investment firm.&lt;br&gt;Member States may allow competent authorities to collaborate with investment firms and credit institutions, their associations and other entities in registering tied agents and in monitoring compliance of tied agents with the requirements of paragraph 3.

&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that MTFs are subject to effective rules, systems and procedures which ensure that the following is complied with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at least 50 % of the issuers whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on the MTF are SMEs at the time when the MTF is registered as an SME growth market and in any calendar year thereafter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appropriate criteria are set for initial and ongoing admission to trading of financial instruments of issuers on the market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on initial admission to trading of financial instruments on the market there is sufficient information published to enable investors to make an informed judgment about whether or not to invest in the financial instruments, either an appropriate admission document or a prospectus if the requirements laid down in Directive 2003/71/EC are applicable in respect of a public offer being made in conjunction with the initial admission to trading of the financial instrument on the MTF;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is appropriate ongoing periodic financial reporting by or on behalf of an issuer on the market, for example audited annual reports;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issuers on the market as defined in point (21) of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, persons discharging managerial responsibilities as defined in point (25) of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 and persons closely associated with them as defined in point (26) of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 comply with relevant requirements applicable to them under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The criteria in paragraph 3 are without prejudice to compliance by the investment firm or market operator operating the MTF with other obligations under this Directive relevant to the operation of MTFs.

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that where a financial instrument of an issuer is admitted to trading on one SME growth market, the financial instrument may also be traded on another SME growth market only where the issuer has been informed and has not objected.

&lt;li&gt;Market operators shall devote adequate human and financial resources to the induction and training of members of the management body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that market operators which are significant in terms of their size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities establish a nomination committee composed of members of the management body who do not perform any executive function in the market operator concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nomination committee shall carry out the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify and recommend, for the approval of the management body or for approval of the general meeting, candidates to fill management body vacancies. In doing so, the nomination committee shall evaluate the balance of knowledge, skills, diversity and experience of the management body. Further, the committee shall prepare a description of the roles and capabilities for a particular appointment, and assess the time commitment expected. Furthermore, the nomination committee shall decide on a target for the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body and prepare a policy on how to increase the number of the underrepresented gender in the management body in order to meet that target;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;periodically, and at least annually, assess the structure, size, composition and performance of the management body, and make recommendations to the management body with regard to any changes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;periodically, and at least annually, assess the knowledge, skills and experience of individual members of the management body and of the management body collectively, and report to the management body accordingly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;periodically review the policy of the management body for selection and appointment of senior management and make recommendations to the management body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;In performing its duties, the nomination committee shall, to the extent possible and on an ongoing basis, take account of the need to ensure that the management body’s decision making is not dominated by any one individual or small group of individuals in a manner that is detrimental to the interests of the market operator as a whole.&lt;br&gt;In performing its duties, the nomination committee shall be able to use any forms of resources it deems appropriate, including external advice.&lt;br&gt;Where, under national law, the management body does not have any competence in the process of selection and appointment of any of its members, this paragraph shall not apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States or competent authorities shall require market operators and their respective nomination committees to engage a broad set of qualities and competences when recruiting members to the management body and for that purpose to put in place a policy promoting diversity on the management body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that the management body of a market operator defines and oversees the implementation of the governance arrangements that ensure effective and prudent management of an organisation, including the segregation of duties in the organisation and the prevention of conflicts of interest, and in a manner that promotes the integrity of the market.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that the management body monitors and periodically assesses the effectiveness of the market operator’s governance arrangements and takes appropriate steps to address any deficiencies.&lt;br&gt;Members of the management body shall have adequate access to information and documents which are needed to oversee and monitor management decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authority shall refuse authorisation if it is not satisfied that the members of the management body of the market operator are of sufficiently good repute, possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience and commit sufficient time to perform their functions, or if there are objective and demonstrable grounds for believing that the management body of the market operator may pose a threat to its effective, sound and prudent management and to the adequate consideration of the integrity of the market.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that, in the process of authorisation of a regulated market, the person or persons who effectively direct the business and the operations of an already authorised regulated market in accordance with this Directive are deemed to comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require the market operator to notify the competent authority of the identity of all members of its management body and of any changes to its membership, along with all information needed to assess whether the market operator complies with paragraphs 1 to 5.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESMA shall issue guidelines on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the notion of sufficient time commitment of a member of the management body to perform that member’s functions, in relation to the individual circumstances and the nature, scale and complexity of activities of the market operator;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the notion of adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2;&lt;/li&gt;

Member States shall require a regulated market to ensure that the parameters for halting trading are appropriately calibrated in a way which takes into account the liquidity of different asset classes and sub-classes, the nature of the market model and types of users and is sufficient to avoid significant disruptions to the orderliness of trading.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that a regulated market reports the parameters for halting trading and any material changes to those parameters to the competent authority in a consistent and comparable manner, and that the competent authority shall in turn report them to ESMA. Member States shall require that where a regulated market which is material in terms of liquidity in that financial instrument halts trading, in any Member State, that trading venue has the necessary systems and procedures in place to ensure that it will notify competent authorities in order for them to coordinate a market-wide response and determine whether it is appropriate to halt trading on other venues on which the financial instrument is traded until trading resumes on the original market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require a regulated market to have in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements, including requiring members or participants to carry out appropriate testing of algorithms and providing environments to facilitate such testing, to ensure that algorithmic trading systems cannot create or contribute to disorderly trading conditions on the market and to manage any disorderly trading conditions which do arise from such algorithmic trading systems, including systems to limit the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions that may be entered into the system by a member or participant, to be able to slow down the flow of orders if there is a risk of its system capacity being reached and to limit and enforce the minimum tick size that may be executed on the market.&lt;/li&gt;

In particular, Member States shall require a regulated market to impose market making obligations in individual shares or a suitable basket of shares in exchange for any rebates that are granted.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall allow a regulated market to adjust its fees for cancelled orders according to the length of time for which the order was maintained and to calibrate the fees to each financial instrument to which they apply.&lt;br&gt;Member States may allow a regulated market to impose a higher fee for placing an order that is subsequently cancelled than an order which is executed and to impose a higher fee on participants placing a high ratio of cancelled orders to executed orders and on those operating a high-frequency algorithmic trading technique in order to reflect the additional burden on system capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require a regulated market to be able to identify, by means of flagging from members or participants, orders generated by algorithmic trading, the different algorithms used for the creation of orders and the relevant persons initiating those orders.

&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that competent authorities, in line with the methodology for calculation determined by ESMA, establish and apply position limits on the size of a net position which a person can hold at all times in commodity derivatives traded on trading venues and economically equivalent OTC contracts. The limits shall be set on the basis of all positions held by a person and those held on its behalf at an aggregate group level in order to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prevent market abuse;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support orderly pricing and settlement conditions, including preventing market distorting positions, and ensuring, in particular, convergence between prices of derivatives in the delivery month and spot prices for the underlying commodity, without prejudice to price discovery on the market for the underlying commodity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Position limits shall not apply to positions held by or on behalf of a non-financial entity and which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity of that non-financial entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position limits shall specify clear quantitative thresholds for the maximum size of a position in a commodity derivative that persons can hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the methodology for calculation that competent authorities are to apply in establishing the spot month position limits and other months’ position limits for physically settled and cash settled commodity derivatives based on the characteristics of the relevant derivative. The methodology for calculation shall take into account at least the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the maturity of the commodity derivative contracts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deliverable supply in the underlying commodity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the overall open interest in that contract and the overall open interest in other financial instruments with the same underlying commodity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the volatility of the relevant markets, including substitute derivatives and the underlying commodity markets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number and size of the market participants;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the characteristics of the underlying commodity market, including patterns of production, consumption and transportation to market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the development of new contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;ESMA shall take into account experience regarding the position limits of investment firms or market operators operating a trading venue and of other jurisdictions.&lt;br&gt;ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph to the Commission by 3 July 2015.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A competent authority shall set limits for each contract in commodity derivatives traded on trading venues based on the methodology for calculation determined by ESMA in accordance with paragraph 3. That position limit shall include economically equivalent OTC contracts.&lt;br&gt;A competent authority shall review position limits where there is a significant change in deliverable supply or open interest or any other significant change on the market, based on its determination of deliverable supply and open interest and reset the position limit in accordance with the methodology for calculation developed by ESMA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall notify ESMA of the exact position limits they intend to set in accordance with the methodology for calculation established by ESMA under paragraph 3. Within two months following receipt of the notification, ESMA shall issue an opinion to the competent authority concerned assessing the compatibility of position limits with the objectives of paragraph 1 and with the methodology for calculation established by ESMA under paragraph 3. ESMA shall publish the opinion on its website. The competent authority concerned shall modify the position limits in accordance with ESMA’s opinion, or provide ESMA with justification why the change is considered to be unnecessary. Where a competent authority imposes limits contrary to an ESMA opinion, it shall immediately publish on its website a notice fully explaining its reasons for doing so.&lt;br&gt;Where ESMA determines that a position limit is not in line with the methodology for calculation in paragraph 3, it shall take action in accordance with its powers under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the same commodity derivative is traded in significant volumes on trading venues in more than one jurisdiction, the competent authority of the trading venue where the largest volume of trading takes place (the central competent authority) shall set the single position limit to be applied on all trading in that contract. The central competent authority shall consult the competent authorities of other trading venues on which that derivative is traded in significant volumes on the single position limit to be applied and any revisions to that single position limit. Where competent authorities do not agree, they shall state in writing the full and detailed reasons why they consider that the requirements laid down in paragraph 1 are not met. ESMA shall settle any dispute arising from a disagreement between competent authorities in accordance with its powers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.&lt;br&gt;The competent authorities of the trading venues where the same commodity derivative is traded and the competent authorities of position holders in that commodity derivative shall put in place cooperation arrangements including exchange of relevant data with each other in order to enable the monitoring and enforcement of the single position limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ESMA shall monitor at least once a year the way competent authorities have implemented the position limits set in accordance with the methodology for calculation established by ESMA under paragraph 3. In doing so, ESMA shall ensure that a single position limit effectively applies to the same contract irrespective of where it is traded in line with paragraph 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that an investment firm or a market operator operating a trading venue which trades commodity derivatives apply position management controls. Those controls shall include at least, the powers for the trading venue to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor the open interest positions of persons;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access information, including all relevant documentation, from persons about the size and purpose of a position or exposure entered into, information about beneficial or underlying owners, any concert arrangements, and any related assets or liabilities in the underlying market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;require a person to terminate or reduce a position, on a temporary or permanent basis as the specific case may require and to unilaterally take appropriate action to ensure the termination or reduction if the person does not comply; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where appropriate, require a person to provide liquidity back into the market at an agreed price and volume on a temporary basis with the express intent of mitigating the effects of a large or dominant position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The position limits and position management controls shall be transparent and non-discriminatory, specifying how they apply to persons and taking account of the nature and composition of market participants and of the use they make of the contracts submitted to trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investment firm or market operator operating the trading venue shall inform the competent authority of the details of position management controls.&lt;br&gt;The competent authority shall communicate the same information as well as the details of the position limits it has established to ESMA, which shall publish and maintain on its website a database with summaries of the position limits and position management controls.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the methods to determine when positions of a person are to be aggregated within a group;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the criteria for determining whether a contract is an economically equivalent OTC contract to that traded on a trading venue, referred to in paragraph 1, in a way that facilitates the reporting of positions taken in equivalent OTC contracts to the relevant competent authority as determined in Article 58(2);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the definition of what constitutes the same commodity derivative and significant volumes under paragraph 6 of this Article;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the methodology for aggregating and netting OTC and on-venue commodity derivatives positions to establish the net position for purposes of assessing compliance with the limits. Such methodologies shall establish criteria to determine which positions may be netted against one another and shall not facilitate the build-up of positions in a manner inconsistent with the objectives set out in paragraph 1 of this Article;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the procedure setting out how persons may apply for the exemption under the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article and how the relevant competent authority will approve such applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the method for calculation to determine the venue where the largest volume of trading in a commodity derivative takes place and significant volumes under paragraph 6 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall not impose limits which are more restrictive than those adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 except in exceptional cases where they are objectively justified and proportionate taking into account the liquidity of the specific market and the orderly functioning of that market. Competent authorities shall publish on their website the details of the more restrictive position limits they decide to impose, which shall be valid for an initial period not exceeding six months from the date of their publication on the website. The more restrictive position limits may be renewed for further periods not exceeding six months at a time if the grounds for the restriction continue to be applicable. If not renewed after that six-month period, they shall automatically expire.&lt;br&gt;Where competent authorities decide to impose more restrictive position limits, they shall notify ESMA. The notification shall include a justification for the more restrictive position limits. ESMA shall, within 24 hours, issue an opinion on whether it considers that the more restrictive position limits are necessary to address the exceptional case. The opinion shall be published on ESMA’s website.&lt;br&gt;Where a competent authority imposes limits contrary to an ESMA opinion, it shall immediately publish on its website a notice fully explaining its reasons for doing so.&lt;/li&gt;

The publication shall include at least information on the type and nature of the infringement and the identity of the persons responsible. That obligation does not apply to decisions imposing measures that are of an investigatory nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, where the publication of the identity of the legal persons or of the personal data of the natural persons is considered by the competent authority to be disproportionate following a case-by-case assessment conducted on the proportionality of the publication of such data, or where publication jeopardises the stability of financial markets or an on-going investigation, Member States shall ensure that competent authorities shall either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defer the publication of the decision to impose the sanction or measure until the moment where the reasons for non-publication cease to exist;&lt;/li&gt;

ESMA shall publish data on criminal sanctions imposed in an annual report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the competent authority has disclosed an administrative measure, sanction or criminal sanction to the public, it shall, at the same time, report that fact to ESMA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a published criminal or administrative sanction relates to an investment firm, market operator, data reporting services provider, credit institution in relation to investment services and activities or ancillary services, or a branch of third-country firms authorised in accordance with this Directive, ESMA shall add a reference to the published sanction in the relevant register.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(13)For the purposes of Chapter IIIA, insurance-based investment product means an insurance product which offers a maturity or surrender value and where that maturity or surrender value is wholly or partially exposed, directly or indirectly, to market fluctuations and shall not include:(a)non-life insurance products as listed in Annex I of Directive 2009/138/EC (Classes of Non-life Insurance);(b)life insurance contracts where the benefits under the contract are payable only on death or in respect of incapacity due to injury, sickness or infirmity;(c)pension products which, under national law, are recognised as having the primary purpose of providing the investor with an income in retirement, and which entitles the investor to certain benefits;(d)officially recognised occupational pension schemes falling under the scope of Directive 2003/41/EC or Directive 2009/138/EC;(e)individual pension products for which a financial contribution from the employer is required by national law and where the employer or the employee has no choice as to the pension product or provider.;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER IIIAAdditional customer protection requirements in relation to insurance-Based investment productsArticle 13aScopeSubject to the exception in the second subparagraph of Article 2(3), this Chapter lays down additional requirements on insurance mediation activities and to direct sales carried out by insurance undertakings when they are carried out in relation to the sale of insurance-based investment products. Those activities shall be referred to as insurance distribution activities.Article 13bPrevention of conflicts of interestAn insurance intermediary or insurance undertaking shall maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps designed to prevent conflicts of interest, as determined in Article 13c, from adversely affecting the interests of its customers.Article 13cConflicts of interests1.Member States shall require insurance intermediaries and insurance undertakings to take all appropriate steps to identify conflicts of interest between themselves, including their managers, employees and tied insurance intermediaries, or any person directly or indirectly linked to them by control and their customers or between one customer and another that arise in the course of carrying out any insurance distribution activities.2.Where organisational or administrative arrangements made by the insurance intermediary or insurance undertaking in accordance with Article 13b to manage conflicts of interest are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that risks of damage to customer interests will be prevented, the insurance intermediary or insurance undertaking shall clearly disclose to the customer the general nature and/or sources of conflicts of interest before undertaking business on its behalf.3.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 13e to:(a)define the steps that insurance intermediaries or insurance undertakings might reasonably be expected to take to identify, prevent, manage and disclose conflicts of interest when carrying out insurance distribution activities;(b)establish appropriate criteria for determining the types of conflict of interest whose existence may damage the interests of the customers or potential customers of the insurance intermediary or insurance undertaking.Article 13dGeneral principles and information to customers1.Member States shall ensure that, when carrying out insurance distribution activities, an insurance intermediary or insurance undertaking acts honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interests of its customers.2.All information, including marketing communications, addressed by the insurance intermediary or insurance undertaking to customers or potential customers shall be fair, clear and not misleading. Marketing communications shall be clearly identifiable as such.3.Member States may prohibit the acceptance or receipt of fees, commissions or any monetary benefits paid or provided to insurance intermediaries or insurance undertakings, by any third party or a person acting on behalf of a third party in relation to the distribution of insurance-based investment products to customers.Article 13eExercise of the delegation1.The power to adopt a delegated act is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.2.The power to adopt a delegated act referred to in Article 13c shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time from 2 July 2014.3.The delegation of powers referred to in Article 13c may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision of revocation shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.4.As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.5.A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 13c shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of three months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by three months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional client is a client who possesses the experience, knowledge and expertise to make its own investment decisions and properly assess the risks that it incurs. In order to be considered to be professional client, the client must comply with the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following shall all be regarded as professionals in all investment services and activities and financial instruments for the purposes of the Directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entities which are required to be authorised or regulated to operate in the financial markets. The list below shall be understood as including all authorised entities carrying out the characteristic activities of the entities mentioned: entities authorised by a Member State under a Directive, entities authorised or regulated by a Member State without reference to a Directive, and entities authorised or regulated by a third country:&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment firms;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other authorised or regulated financial institutions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insurance companies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collective investment schemes and management companies of such schemes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pension funds and management companies of such funds;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity and commodity derivatives dealers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locals;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other institutional investors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large undertakings meeting two of the following size requirements on a company basis:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;balance sheet total&lt;/span&gt; = EUR 20000000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;net turnover&lt;/span&gt; = EUR 40000000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;own funds&lt;/span&gt; = EUR 2000000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National and regional governments, including public bodies that manage public debt at national or regional level, Central Banks, international and supranational institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, the ECB, the EIB and other similar international organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other institutional investors whose main activity is to invest in financial instruments, including entities dedicated to the securitisation of assets or other financing transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entities referred to above are considered to be professionals. They must however be allowed to request non-professional treatment and investment firms may agree to provide a higher level of protection. Where the client of an investment firm is an undertaking referred to above, the investment firm must inform it prior to any provision of services that, on the basis of the information available to the investment firm, the client is deemed to be a professional client, and will be treated as such unless the investment firm and the client agree otherwise. The investment firm must also inform the customer that he can request a variation of the terms of the agreement in order to secure a higher degree of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the responsibility of the client, considered to be a professional client, to ask for a higher level of protection when it deems it is unable to properly assess or manage the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This higher level of protection will be provided when a client who is considered to be a professional enters into a written agreement with the investment firm to the effect that it shall not be treated as a professional for the purposes of the applicable conduct of business regime. Such agreement shall specify whether this applies to one or more particular services or transactions, or to one or more types of product or transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients other than those mentioned in section I, including public sector bodies, local public authorities, municipalities and private individual investors, may also be allowed to waive some of the protections afforded by the conduct of business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment firms shall therefore be allowed to treat any of those clients as professionals provided the relevant criteria and procedure mentioned below are fulfilled. Those clients shall not, however, be presumed to possess market knowledge and experience comparable to that of the categories listed in Section I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any such waiver of the protection afforded by the standard conduct of business regime shall be considered to be valid only if an adequate assessment of the expertise, experience and knowledge of the client, undertaken by the investment firm, gives reasonable assurance, in light of the nature of the transactions or services envisaged, that the client is capable of making investment decisions and understanding the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fitness test applied to managers and directors of entities licensed under Directives in the financial field could be regarded as an example of the assessment of expertise and knowledge. In the case of small entities, the person subject to that assessment shall be the person authorised to carry out transactions on behalf of the entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of that assessment, as a minimum, two of the following criteria shall be satisfied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the client has carried out transactions, in significant size, on the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four quarters,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the size of the client’s financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and financial instruments exceeds EUR 500000,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the client works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position, which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States may adopt specific criteria for the assessment of the expertise and knowledge of municipalities and local public authorities requesting to be treated as professional clients. Those criteria can be alternative or additional to those listed in the fifth paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those clients may waive the benefit of the detailed rules of conduct only where the following procedure is followed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they must state in writing to the investment firm that they wish to be treated as a professional client, either generally or in respect of a particular investment service or transaction, or type of transaction or product,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the investment firm must give them a clear written warning of the protections and investor compensation rights they may lose,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they must state in writing, in a separate document from the contract, that they are aware of the consequences of losing such protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before deciding to accept any request for waiver, investment firms must be required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the client requesting to be treated as a professional client meets the relevant requirements stated in Section II.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if clients have already been categorised as professionals under parameters and procedures similar to those referred to above, it is not intended that their relationships with investment firms shall be affected by any new rules adopted pursuant to this Annex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms must implement appropriate written internal policies and procedures to categorise clients. Professional clients are responsible for keeping the investment firm informed about any change, which could affect their current categorisation. Should the investment firm become aware however that the client no longer fulfils the initial conditions, which made him eligible for a professional treatment, the investment firm shall take appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;</td><td>PROFESSIONAL CLIENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS DIRECTIVE</td><td>ANNEX II</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;p class=&quot;title-gr-seq-level-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;italics&quot;&gt;PART A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
