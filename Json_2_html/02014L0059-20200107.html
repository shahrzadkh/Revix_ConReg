Member States may exceptionally provide for the resolution authority to be the competent authorities for supervision for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU. Adequate structural arrangements shall be in place to ensure operational independence and avoid conflicts of interest between the functions of supervision pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU or the other functions of the relevant authority and the functions of resolution authorities pursuant to this Directive, without prejudice to the exchange of information and cooperation obligations as required by paragraph 4. In particular, Member States shall ensure that, within the competent authorities, national central banks, competent ministries or other authorities there is operational independence between the resolution function and the supervisory or other functions of the relevant authority.&lt;br&gt;The staff involved in carrying out the functions of the resolution authority pursuant to this Directive shall be structurally separated from, and subject to, separate reporting lines from the staff involved in carrying out the tasks pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU or with regard to the other functions of the relevant authority.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this paragraph, the Member States or the resolution authority shall adopt and make public any necessary relevant internal rules including rules regarding professional secrecy and information exchanges between the different functional areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that authorities exercising supervision and resolution functions and persons exercising those functions on their behalf cooperate closely in the preparation, planning and application of resolution decisions, both where the resolution authority and the competent authority are separate entities and where the functions are carried out in the same entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Member State shall designate a single ministry which is responsible for exercising the functions of the competent ministry under this Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the resolution authority in a Member State is not the competent ministry it shall inform the competent ministry of the decisions pursuant to this Directive and, unless otherwise laid down in national law, have its approval before implementing decisions that have a direct fiscal impact or systemic implications.&lt;/li&gt;

Recovery plans shall be considered to be a governance arrangement within the meaning of Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall ensure that the institutions update their recovery plans at least annually or after a change to the legal or organisational structure of the institution, its business or its financial situation, which could have a material effect on, or necessitates a change to, the recovery plan. Competent authorities may require institutions to update their recovery plans more frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovery plans shall not assume any access to or receipt of extraordinary public financial support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovery plans shall include, where applicable, an analysis of how and when an institution may apply, in the conditions addressed by the plan, for the use of central bank facilities and identify those assets which would be expected to qualify as collateral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to Article 4, Member States shall ensure that the recovery plans include the information listed in Section A of the Annex. Member States may require that additional information is included in the recovery plans.&lt;br&gt;Recovery plans shall also include possible measures which could be taken by the institution where the conditions for early intervention under Article 27 are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require that recovery plans include appropriate conditions and procedures to ensure the timely implementation of recovery actions as well as a wide range of recovery options.

Member States shall require institutions to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that those plans meet the criteria of paragraph 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competent authorities shall, within six months of the submission of each plan, and after consulting the competent authorities of the Member States where significant branches are located insofar as is relevant to that branch, review it and assess the extent to which it satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 5 and the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the implementation of the arrangements proposed in the plan is reasonably likely to maintain or restore the viability and financial position of the institution or of the group, taking into account the preparatory measures that the institution has taken or has planned to take;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the plan and specific options within the plan are reasonably likely to be implemented quickly and effectively in situations of financial stress and avoiding to the maximum extent possible any significant adverse effect on the financial system, including in scenarios which would lead other institutions to implement recovery plans within the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When assessing the appropriateness of the recovery plans, the competent authority shall take into consideration the appropriateness of the institution’s capital and funding structure to the level of complexity of the organisational structure and the risk profile of the institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authority shall provide the recovery plan to the resolution authority. The resolution authority may examine the recovery plan with a view to identifying any actions in the recovery plan which may adversely impact the resolvability of the institution and make recommendations to the competent authority with regard to those matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the competent authority assesses that there are material deficiencies in the recovery plan, or material impediments to its implementation, it shall notify the institution or the parent undertaking of the group of its assessment and require the institution to submit, within two months, extendable with the authorities’ approval by one month, a revised plan demonstrating how those deficiencies or impediments are addressed.&lt;br&gt;Before requiring an institution to resubmit a recovery plan the competent authority shall give the institution the opportunity to state its opinion on that requirement.&lt;br&gt;Where the competent authority does not consider the deficiencies and impediments to have been adequately addressed by the revised plan, it may direct the institution to make specific changes to the plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the institution fails to submit a revised recovery plan, or if the competent authority determines that the revised recovery plan does not adequately remedy the deficiencies or potential impediments identified in its original assessment, and it is not possible to adequately remedy the deficiencies or impediments through a direction to make specific changes to the plan, the competent authority shall require the institution to identify within a reasonable timeframe changes it can make to its business in order to address the deficiencies in or impediments to the implementation of the recovery plan.&lt;br&gt;If the institution fails to identify such changes within the timeframe set by the competent authority, or if the competent authority assesses that the actions proposed by the institution would not adequately address the deficiencies or impediments, the competent authority may direct the institution to take any measures it considers to be necessary and proportionate, taking into account the seriousness of the deficiencies and impediments and the effect of the measures on the institution’s business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competent authority may, without prejudice to Article 104 of Directive 2013/36/EU, direct the institution to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce the risk profile of the institution, including liquidity risk;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;make changes to the governance structure of the institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The list of measures referred to in this paragraph does not preclude Member States from authorising competent authorities to take additional measures under national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the competent authority requires an institution to take measures according to paragraph 6, its decision on the measures shall be reasoned and proportionate.&lt;br&gt;The decision shall be notified in writing to the institution and subject to a right of appeal.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;make payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where an entity is in the situation referred to in the first subparagraph, it shall immediately notify the resolution authority thereof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the situation referred to in paragraph 1, the resolution authority of the entity, after consulting the competent authority, shall without unnecessary delay assess whether to exercise the power referred to in paragraph 1, taking into account all of the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reason, duration and magnitude of the failure and its impact on resolvability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the development of the entity&#x27;s financial situation and the likelihood of it fulfilling, in the foreseeable future, the condition referred to in point (a) of Article 32(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the prospect that the entity will be able to ensure compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 within a reasonable timeframe;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the entity is unable to replace liabilities that no longer meet the eligibility or maturity criteria laid down in Articles 72b and 72c of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or in Article 45b or Article 45f(2) of this Directive, if that inability is idiosyncratic or is due to market-wide disturbance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the exercise of the power referred to in paragraph 1 is the most adequate and proportionate means of addressing the situation of the entity, taking into account its potential impact on both the financing conditions and resolvability of the entity concerned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The resolution authority shall repeat its assessment of whether to exercise the power referred to in paragraph 1 at least every month for as long as the entity continues to be in the situation referred to in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the resolution authority finds that the entity is still in the situation referred to in paragraph 1 nine months after such situation has been notified by the entity, the resolution authority, after consulting the competent authority, shall exercise the power referred to in paragraph 1, except where the resolution authority finds, following an assessment, that at least two of the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the failure is due to a serious disturbance to the functioning of financial markets which leads to broad-based financial market stress across several segments of financial markets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the disturbance referred to in point (a) not only results in the increased price volatility of the own funds instruments and eligible liabilities instruments of the entity or increased costs for the entity, but also leads to a full or partial closure of markets which prevents the entity from issuing own funds instruments and eligible liabilities instruments on those markets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market closure referred to in point (b) is observed not only for the concerned entity, but also for several other entities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the disturbance referred to in point (a) prevents the concerned entity from issuing own funds instruments and eligible liabilities instruments sufficient to remedy the failure; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an exercise of the power referred to in paragraph 1 leads to negative spill-over effects for part of the banking sector, thereby potentially undermining financial stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where the exception referred to in the first subparagraph applies, the resolution authority shall notify the competent authority of its decision and shall explain its assessment in writing.&lt;br&gt;Every month, the resolution authority shall repeat its assessment of whether the exception referred to in the first subparagraph applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The M-MDA shall be calculated by multiplying the sum calculated in accordance with paragraph 5 by the factor determined in accordance with paragraph 6. The M-MDA shall be reduced by any amount resulting from any of the actions referred to in points (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum to be multiplied in accordance with paragraph 4 shall consist of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any interim profits not included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital pursuant to Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, net of any distribution of profits or any payment resulting from the actions referred to in points (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any year-end profits not included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital pursuant to Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, net of any distribution of profits or any payment resulting from the actions referred to in points (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Within four months of the date of receipt of a notification made in accordance with paragraph 1, the entity shall propose to the resolution authority possible measures to address or remove the substantive impediments identified in the notification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entity shall, within two weeks of the date of receipt of a notification made in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, propose to the resolution authority possible measures and the timeline for their implementation to ensure that the entity complies with Article 45e or 45f of this Directive and the combined buffer requirement, where a substantive impediment to resolvability is due to either of the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the entity meets the combined buffer requirement when considered in addition to each of the requirements referred to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 141a(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, but it does not meet the combined buffer requirement when considered in addition to the requirements referred to in Articles 45c and 45d of this Directive when calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2) of this Directive; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the entity does not meet the requirements referred to in Articles 92a and 494 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or the requirements referred to in Articles 45c and 45d of this Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The timeline for the implementation of measures proposed under the second subparagraph shall take into account the reasons for the substantive impediment.&lt;br&gt;The resolution authority, after consulting the competent authority, shall assess whether the measures proposed under the first and second subparagraphs effectively address or remove the substantive impediment in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the resolution authority finds that the measures proposed by an entity in accordance with paragraph 3 do not effectively reduce or remove the impediments in question, it shall, either directly or indirectly through the competent authority, require the entity to take alternative measures that may achieve that objective, and notify in writing those measures to the entity, which shall propose within one month a plan to comply with them.&lt;br&gt;In identifying alternative measures, the resolution authority shall demonstrate how the measures proposed by the entity would not be able to remove the impediments to resolvability and how the alternative measures proposed are proportionate in removing them. The resolution authority shall take into account the threat that those impediments to resolvability present for financial stability and the effect of the measures on the business of the entity, its stability and its ability to contribute to the economy.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The group-level resolution authority, in cooperation with the consolidating supervisor and EBA in accordance with Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, shall prepare and submit a report to the Union parent undertaking, to the resolution authorities of subsidiaries, which shall provide it to the subsidiaries within their remit, and to the resolution authorities of jurisdictions in which significant branches are located. The report shall be prepared after consulting the competent authorities, and shall analyse the substantive impediments to the effective application of the resolution tools and the exercising of the resolution powers in relation to the group, and also in relation to resolution groups where a group is composed of more than one resolution group. The report shall consider the impact on the group&#x27;s business model and recommend any proportionate and targeted measures that, in the view of the group-level resolution authority, are necessary or appropriate to remove those impediments.&lt;br&gt;Where an impediment to the resolvability of the group is due to a situation of a group entity referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 17(3), the group-level resolution authority shall notify its assessment of that impediment to the Union parent undertaking after consulting the resolution authority of the resolution entity and the resolution authorities of its subsidiary institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within four months of the date of receipt of the report, the Union parent undertaking may submit observations and propose to the group-level resolution authority alternative measures to remedy the impediments identified in the report.&lt;br&gt;Where the impediments identified in the report are due to a situation of a group entity referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 17(3) of this Directive, the Union parent undertaking shall, within two weeks of the date of receipt of a notification made in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article, propose to the group-level resolution authority possible measures and the timeline for their implementation to ensure that the group entity complies with the requirements referred to in Articles 45e or 45f of this Directive expressed as a percentage of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and, where applicable, with the combined buffer requirement, and with the requirements referred to in Article 45e and 45f of this Directive expressed as a percentage of the total exposure measure referred to in Articles 429 and 429a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.&lt;br&gt;The timeline for the implementation of measures proposed under the second subparagraph shall take into account the reasons for the substantive impediment.

&lt;li&gt;The previous adoption of an early intervention measure according to Article 27 is not a condition for taking a resolution action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1, an institution shall be deemed to be failing or likely to fail in one or more of the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution infringes or there are objective elements to support a determination that the institution will, in the near future, infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation in a way that would justify the withdrawal of the authorisation by the competent authority including but not limited to because the institution has incurred or is likely to incur losses that will deplete all or a significant amount of its own funds;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the assets of the institution are or there are objective elements to support a determination that the assets of the institution will, in the near future, be less than its liabilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution is or there are objective elements to support a determination that the institution will, in the near future, be unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary public financial support is required except when, in order to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State and preserve financial stability, the extraordinary public financial support takes any of the following forms:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a State guarantee to back liquidity facilities provided by central banks according to the central banks’ conditions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a State guarantee of newly issued liabilities; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an injection of own funds or purchase of capital instruments at prices and on terms that do not confer an advantage upon the institution, where neither the circumstances referred to in point (a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph nor the circumstances referred to in Article 59(3) are present at the time the public support is granted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;In each of the cases mentioned in points (d)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the first subparagraph, the guarantee or equivalent measures referred to therein shall be confined to solvent institutions and shall be conditional on final approval under the Union State aid framework. Those measures shall be of a precautionary and temporary nature and shall be proportionate to remedy the consequences of the serious disturbance and shall not be used to offset losses that the institution has incurred or is likely to incur in the near future.&lt;br&gt;Support measures under point (d)(iii) of the first subparagraph shall be limited to injections necessary to address capital shortfall established in the national, Union or SSM-wide stress tests, asset quality reviews or equivalent exercises conducted by the European Central Bank, EBA or national authorities, where applicable, confirmed by the competent authority.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall, by 3 January 2015, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 on the type of tests, reviews or exercises referred to above which may lead to such support.&lt;br&gt;By 31 December 2015, the Commission shall review whether there is a continuing need for allowing the support measures under point (d)(iii) of the first subparagraph and the conditions that need to be met in the case of continuation and report thereon to the European Parliament and to the Council. If appropriate, that report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article, a resolution action shall be treated as in the public interest if it is necessary for the achievement of and is proportionate to one or more of the resolution objectives referred to in Article 31 and winding up of the institution under normal insolvency proceedings would not meet those resolution objectives to the same extent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall, by 3 July 2015, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to promote the convergence of supervisory and resolution practices regarding the interpretation of the different circumstances when an institution shall be considered to be failing or likely to fail.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities take a resolution action in relation to an entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), when that entity meets the conditions laid down in Article 32(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the subsidiary institutions of a mixed-activity holding company are held directly or indirectly by an intermediate financial holding company, the resolution plan shall provide that the intermediate financial holding company is identified as a resolution entity and Member States shall ensure that resolution actions for the purposes of group resolution are taken in relation to the intermediate financial holding company.

&lt;li&gt;assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries referred to in point (b) are such that the failure of those subsidiaries threatens the resolution group as a whole, and resolution action with regard to the entity is necessary either for the resolution of such subsidiaries which are institutions or for the resolution of the relevant resolution group as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a determination that the institution or entity is failing or likely to fail has been made under point (a) of Article 32(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no immediately available private sector measure referred to in point (b) of Article 32(1) that would prevent the failure of the institution or entity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exercise of the power to suspend is deemed necessary to avoid the further deterioration of the financial conditions of the institution or entity; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exercise of the power to suspend is either:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;necessary to reach the determination provided for in point (c) of Article 32(1); or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;necessary to choose the appropriate resolution actions or to ensure the effective application of one or more resolution tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to payment or delivery obligations to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;The resolution authorities shall set the scope of the power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article having regard to the circumstances of each case. In particular, resolution authorities shall carefully assess the appropriateness of extending the suspension to eligible deposits according to the definition in point (4) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2014/49/EU, especially to covered deposits held by natural persons and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may provide that where the power to suspend payment or delivery obligations is exercised in respect of eligible deposits, resolution authorities ensure that depositors have access to an appropriate daily amount from those deposits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The period of the suspension pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be as short as possible and shall not exceed the minimum period of time that the resolution authority considers necessary for the purposes indicated in points (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 and in any event shall not last longer than the period from the publication of a notice of suspension pursuant to paragraph 8 to midnight in the Member State of the resolution authority of the institution or entity at the end of the business day following the day of the publication.&lt;br&gt;At the expiry of the period of suspension referred to in the first subparagraph, the suspension shall cease to have effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When exercising the power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, resolution authorities shall have regard to the impact the exercise of that power might have on the orderly functioning of financial markets and shall consider the existing national rules, as well as supervisory and judicial powers, to safeguard creditors&#x27; rights and equal treatment of creditors in normal insolvency proceedings. Resolution authorities shall in particular have regard to the potential application of national insolvency proceedings to the institution or entity as a result of the determination in point (c) of Article 32(1) and shall make the arrangements they deem appropriate to ensure adequate coordination with the national administrative or judicial authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When payment or delivery obligations under a contract are suspended pursuant to paragraph 1, the payment or delivery obligations of any counterparties to that contract shall be suspended for the same period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A payment or delivery obligation that would have been due during the period of the suspension shall be due immediately upon expiry of that period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities notify the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) and the authorities referred to in points (a) to (h) of Article 83(2) without delay when exercising the power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article after a determination has been made that the institution is failing or likely to fail pursuant to point (a) of Article 32(1) and before the resolution decision is taken.&lt;br&gt;The resolution authority shall publish or ensure the publication of the order or instrument by which obligations are suspended under this Article and the terms and period of suspension, by the means referred to in Article 83(4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Article is without prejudice to the provisions contained in the national law of Member States granting powers to suspend payment or delivery obligations of the institutions and entities referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article before a determination is made that those institutions or entities are failing or likely to fail under point (a) of Article 32(1) or to suspend payment or delivery obligations of institutions or entities which are to be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, and that exceed the scope and duration provided for in this Article.

&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that when a resolution authority exercises the power to suspend payment or delivery obligations with respect to an institution or an entity referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the resolution authority is also able, for the duration of that suspension, to exercise the power to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restrict secured creditors of that institution or entity from enforcing security interests in relation to any of the assets of that institution or entity for the same duration, in which case Article 70(2), (3) and (4) shall apply; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suspend the termination rights of any party to a contract with that institution or entity for the same duration, in which case Article 71(2) to (8) shall apply.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;management body and senior management of the institution under resolution shall provide all necessary assistance for the achievement of the resolution objectives;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;natural and legal persons are made liable, subject to Member State law, under civil or criminal law for their responsibility for the failure of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;except where otherwise provided in this Directive, creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no creditor shall incur greater losses than would have been incurred if the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings in accordance with the safeguards in Articles 73 to 75;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;covered deposits are fully protected; and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The objective of the valuation shall be to assess the value of the assets and liabilities of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) that meets the conditions for resolution of Articles 32 and 33.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purposes of the valuation shall be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to inform the determination of whether the conditions for resolution or the conditions for the write down or conversion of capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 are met;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the conditions for resolution are met, to inform the decision on the appropriate resolution action to be taken in respect of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 is applied, to inform the decision on the extent of the cancellation or dilution of shares or other instruments of ownership, and the extent of the write down or conversion of relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the bail-in tool is applied, to inform the decision on the extent of the write down or conversion of bail-inable liabilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the bridge institution tool or asset separation tool is applied, to inform the decision on the assets, rights, liabilities or shares or other instruments of ownership to be transferred and the decision on the value of any consideration to be paid to the institution under resolution or, as the case may be, to the owners of the shares or other instruments of ownership;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the sale of business tool is applied, to inform the decision on the assets, rights, liabilities or shares or other instruments of ownership to be transferred and to inform the resolution authority’s understanding of what constitutes commercial terms for the purposes of Article 38;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in all cases, to ensure that any losses on the assets of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) are fully recognised at the moment the resolution tools are applied or the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 is exercised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, where applicable, the valuation shall be based on prudent assumptions, including as to rates of default and severity of losses. The valuation shall not assume any potential future provision of extraordinary public financial support or central bank emergency liquidity assistance or any central bank liquidity assistance provided under non-standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms to the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) from the point at which resolution action is taken or the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 is exercised. Furthermore, the valuation shall take account of the fact that, if any resolution tool is applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority and any financing arrangement acting pursuant to Article 101 may recover any reasonable expenses properly incurred from the institution under resolution, in accordance with Article 37(7);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution financing arrangement may charge interest or fees in respect of any loans or guarantees provided to the institution under resolution, in accordance with Article 101.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The valuation shall be supplemented by the following information as appearing in the accounting books and records of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an updated balance sheet and a report on the financial position of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an analysis and an estimate of the accounting value of the assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the list of outstanding on balance sheet and off balance sheet liabilities shown in the books and records of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), with an indication of the respective credits and priority levels under the applicable insolvency law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate, to inform the decisions referred to in points (e) and (f) of paragraph 4, the information in point (b) of paragraph 6 may be complemented by an analysis and estimate of the value of the assets and liabilities of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) on a market value basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The valuation shall indicate the subdivision of the creditors in classes in accordance with their priority levels under the applicable insolvency law and an estimate of the treatment that each class of shareholders and creditors would have been expected to receive, if the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) were wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.&lt;br&gt;That estimate shall not affect the application of the no creditor worse off principle to be carried out under Article 74.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where due to the urgency in the circumstances of the case it is not possible to comply with the requirements in paragraphs 6 and 8 or paragraph 2 applies, a provisional valuation shall be carried out. The provisional valuation shall comply with the requirements in paragraph 3 and in so far as reasonably practicable in the circumstances with the requirements of paragraphs 1, 6 and 8.&lt;br&gt;The provisional valuation referred to in this paragraph shall include a buffer for additional losses, with appropriate justification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A valuation that does not comply with all the requirements laid down in this Article shall be considered to be provisional until an independent person has carried out a valuation that is fully compliant with all the requirements laid down in this Article. That ex-post definitive valuation shall be carried out as soon as practicable. It may be carried out either separately from the valuation referred to in Article 74, or simultaneously with and by the same independent person as that valuation, but shall be distinct from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purposes of the ex-post definitive valuation shall be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to ensure that any losses on the assets of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) are fully recognised in the books of accounts of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to inform a decision to write back creditors’ claims or to increase the value of the consideration paid, in accordance with paragraph 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event that the ex-post definitive valuation’s estimate of the net asset value of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) is higher than the provisional valuation’s estimate of the net asset value of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), the resolution authority may:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise its power to increase the value of the claims of creditors or owners of relevant capital instruments which have been written down under the bail-in tool;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instruct a bridge institution or asset management vehicle to make a further payment of consideration in respect of the assets, rights, liabilities to the institution under resolution, or as the case may be, in respect of the shares or instruments of ownership to the owners of the shares or other instruments of ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a provisional valuation conducted in accordance with paragraphs 9 and 10 shall be a valid basis for resolution authorities take resolution actions, including taking control of a failing institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), or to exercise the write down or conversion power of capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The valuation shall be an integral part of the decision to apply a resolution tool or exercise a resolution power, or the decision to exercise the write down or conversion power of capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59. The valuation itself shall not be subject to a separate right of appeal but may be subject to an appeal together with the decision in accordance with Article 85.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the circumstances in which a person is independent from both the resolution authority and the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) for the purposes of paragraph 1of this Article, and for the purposes of Article 74.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBA may develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following criteria for the purposes of paragraphs 1, 3 and 9 of this Article, and for the purposes of Article 74:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the methodology for assessing the value of the assets and liabilities of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the separation of the valuations under Articles 36 and 74;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the methodology for calculating and including a buffer for additional losses in the provisional valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall submit the draft regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 14 to the Commission by 3 July 2015.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraphs 14 and 15 in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the necessary powers to apply the resolution tools to institutions and to entities referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) that meet the applicable conditions for resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a resolution authority decides to apply a resolution tool to an institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), and that resolution action would result in losses being borne by creditors or their claims being converted, the resolution authority shall exercise the power to write down and convert capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 immediately before or together with the application of the resolution tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution tools referred to in paragraph 1 are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sale of business tool;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bridge institution tool;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the asset separation tool;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bail-in tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject to paragraph 5, resolution authorities may apply the resolution tools individually or in any combination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolution authorities may apply the asset separation tool only together with another resolution tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where only the resolution tools referred to in point (a) or (b) of paragraph 3 of this Article are used, and they are used to transfer only part of the assets, rights or liabilities of the institution under resolution, the residual institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) from which the assets, rights or liabilities have been transferred, shall be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. Such winding up shall be done within a reasonable timeframe, having regard to any need for that institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) to provide services or support pursuant to Article 65 in order to enable the recipient to carry out the activities or services acquired by virtue of that transfer, and any other reason that the continuation of the residual institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) is necessary to achieve the resolution objectives or comply with the principles referred to in Article 34.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution authority and any financing arrangement acting pursuant to Article 101 may recover any reasonable expenses properly incurred in connection with the use of the resolution tools or powers or government financial stabilisation tools in one or more of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a deduction from any consideration paid by a recipient to the institution under resolution or, as the case may be, to the owners of the shares or other instruments of ownership;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from the institution under resolution, as a preferred creditor; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from any proceeds generated as a result of the termination of the operation of the bridge institution or the asset management vehicle, as a preferred creditor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that rules under national insolvency law relating to the voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to creditors do not apply to transfers of assets, rights or liabilities from an institution under resolution to another entity by virtue of the application of a resolution tool or exercise of a resolution power, or use of a government financial stabilisation tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States may confer upon resolution authorities additional tools and powers exercisable where an institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) meets the conditions for resolution, provided that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when applied to a cross-border group, those additional powers do not pose obstacles to effective group resolution; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are consistent with the resolution objectives and the general principles governing resolution referred to in Articles 31 and 34.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the very extraordinary situation of a systemic crisis, the resolution authority may seek funding from alternative financing sources through the use of government stabilisation tools provided for in Articles 56 to 58 when the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation equal to an amount not less than 8 % of total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution, measured at the time of resolution action in accordance with the valuation provided for in Article 36, has been made by the shareholders and the holders of other instruments of ownership, the holders of relevant capital instruments and other bail-inable liabilities through write down, conversion or otherwise;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall be conditional on prior and final approval under the Union State aid framework.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shares or other instruments of ownership issued by an institution under resolution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all or any assets, rights or liabilities of an institution under resolution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Subject to paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Article and to Article 85, the transfer referred to in the first subparagraph shall take place without obtaining the consent of the shareholders of the institution under resolution or any third party other than the purchaser, and without complying with any procedural requirements under company or securities law other than those included in Article 39.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A transfer made pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be made on commercial terms, having regard to the circumstances, and in accordance with the Union State aid framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, resolution authorities shall take all reasonable steps to obtain commercial terms for the transfer that conform with the valuation conducted under Article 36, having regard to the circumstances of the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to Article 37(7), any consideration paid by the purchaser shall benefit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the owners of the shares or other instruments of ownership, where the sale of business has been effected by transferring shares or instruments of ownership issued by the institution under resolution from the holders of those shares or instruments to the purchaser;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution under resolution, where the sale of business has been effected by transferring some or all of the assets or liabilities of the institution under resolution to the purchaser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When applying the sale of business tool the resolution authority may exercise the transfer power more than once in order to make supplemental transfers of shares or other instruments of ownership issued by an institution under resolution or, as the case may be, assets, rights or liabilities of the institution under resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following an application of the sale of business tool, resolution authorities may, with the consent of the purchaser, exercise the transfer powers in respect of assets, rights or liabilities transferred to the purchaser in order to transfer the assets, rights or liabilities back to the institution under resolution, or the shares or other instruments of ownership back to their original owners, and the institution under resolution or original owners shall be obliged to take back any such assets, rights or liabilities, or shares or other instruments of ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A purchaser shall have the appropriate authorisation to carry out the business it acquires when the transfer is made pursuant to paragraph 1. Competent authorities shall ensure that an application for authorisation shall be considered, in conjunction with the transfer, in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By way of derogation from Articles 22 to 25 of Directive 2013/36/EU, from the requirement to inform the competent authorities in Article 26 of Directive 2013/36/EU, from Article 10(3), Article 11(1) and (2) and Articles 12 and 13 of Directive 2014/65/EU and from the requirement to give a notice in Article 11(3) of that Directive, where a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership by virtue of an application of the sale of business tool would result in the acquisition of or increase in a qualifying holding in an institution of a kind referred to in Article 22(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU or Article 11(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, the competent authority of that institution shall carry out the assessment required under those Articles in a timely manner that does not delay the application of the sale of business tool and prevent the resolution action from achieving the relevant resolution objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that if the competent authority of that institution has not completed the assessment referred to in paragraph 8 from the date of transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership in the application of the sale of business tool by the resolution authority, the following provisions shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer shall have immediate legal effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during the assessment period and during any divestment period provided by point (f), the acquirer’s voting rights attached to such shares or other instruments of ownership shall be suspended and vested solely in the resolution authority, which shall have no obligation to exercise any such voting rights and which shall have no liability whatsoever for exercising or refraining from exercising any such voting rights;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during the assessment period and during any divestment period provided by point (f), the penalties and other measures for infringing the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying holdings contemplated by Articles 66, 67 and 68 of Directive 2013/36/EU shall not apply to such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promptly upon completion of the assessment by the competent authority, the competent authority shall notify the resolution authority and the acquirer in writing of whether the competent authority approves or, in accordance with Article 22(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU, opposes such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the competent authority approves such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer, then the voting rights attached to such shares or other instruments of ownership shall be deemed to be fully vested in the acquirer immediately upon receipt by the resolution authority and the acquirer of such an approval notice from the competent authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the competent authority opposes such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer, then:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the voting rights attached to such shares or other instruments of ownership as provided by point (b) shall remain in full force and effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority may require the acquirer to divest such shares or other instruments of ownership within a divestment period determined by the resolution authority having taken into account prevailing market conditions; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the acquirer does not complete such a divestment within the divestment period established by the resolution authority, then the competent authority, with the consent of the resolution authority, may impose on the acquirer penalties and other measures for infringing the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying holdings contemplated by Articles 66, 67, and 68 of Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfers made by virtue of the sale of business tool shall be subject to the safeguards referred to in Chapter VII of Title IV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of exercising the rights to provide services or to establish itself in another Member State in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU, the purchaser shall be considered to be a continuation of the institution under resolution, and may continue to exercise any such right that was exercised by the institution under resolution in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities transferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that the purchaser referred to in paragraph 1 may continue to exercise the rights of membership and access to payment, clearing and settlement systems, stock exchanges, investor compensation schemes and deposit guarantee schemes of the institution under resolution, provided that it meets the membership and participation criteria for participation in such systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, Member States shall ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access is not denied on the ground that the purchaser does not possess a rating from a credit rating agency, or that rating is not commensurate to the rating levels required to be granted access to the systems referred to in the first subparagraph;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the purchaser does not meet the membership or participation criteria for a relevant payment, clearing or settlement system, stock exchange, investor compensation scheme or deposit guarantee scheme, the rights referred to in the first subparagraph are exercised for such a period of time as may be specified by the resolution authority, not exceeding 24 months, renewable on application by the purchaser to the resolution authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to Chapter VII of Title IV, shareholders or creditors of the institution under resolution and other third parties whose assets, rights or liabilities are not transferred shall not have any rights over or in relation to the assets, rights or liabilities transferred.&lt;/li&gt;

Pools of rights, assets, and liabilities may be marketed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, where applicable, the marketing referred to in paragraph 1 shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall be as transparent as possible and shall not materially misrepresent the assets, rights, liabilities, shares or other instruments of ownership of that institution that the authority intends to transfer, having regard to the circumstances and in particular the need to maintain financial stability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall not unduly favour or discriminate between potential purchasers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall be free from any conflict of interest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall not confer any unfair advantage on a potential purchaser;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall take account of the need to effect a rapid resolution action;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall aim at maximising, as far as possible, the sale price for the shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Subject to point (b) of the first subparagraph, the principles referred to in this paragraph shall not prevent the resolution authority from soliciting particular potential purchasers.&lt;br&gt;Any public disclosure of the marketing of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) of this Directive that would otherwise be required in accordance with Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 may be delayed in accordance with Article 17(4) or (5) of that Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution authority may apply the sale of business tool without complying with the requirement to market as laid down in paragraph 1 when it determines that compliance with those requirements would be likely to undermine one or more of the resolution objectives and in particular if the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it considers that there is a material threat to financial stability arising from or aggravated by the failure or likely failure of the institution under resolution; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it considers that compliance with those requirements would be likely to undermine the effectiveness of the sale of business tool in addressing that threat or achieving the resolution objective referred to in point (b) of Article 31(2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall, by 3 July 2015, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 specifying the factual circumstances amounting to a material threat and the elements relating to the effectiveness of the sale of business tool provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shares or other instruments of ownership issued by one or more institutions under resolution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all or any assets, rights or liabilities of one or more institutions under resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Subject to Article 85, the transfer referred to in the first subparagraph may take place without obtaining the consent of the shareholders of the institutions under resolution or any third party other than the bridge institution, and without complying with any procedural requirements under company or securities law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge institution shall be a legal person that meets all of the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is wholly or partially owned by one or more public authorities which may include the resolution authority or the resolution financing arrangement and is controlled by the resolution authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is created for the purpose of receiving and holding some or all of the shares or other instruments of ownership issued by an institution under resolution or some or all of the assets, rights and liabilities of one or more institutions under resolution with a view to maintaining access to critical functions and selling the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The application of the bail-in tool for the purpose referred to in point (b) of Article 43(2) shall not interfere with the ability of the resolution authority to control the bridge institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When applying the bridge institution tool, the resolution authority shall ensure that the total value of liabilities transferred to the bridge institution does not exceed the total value of the rights and assets transferred from the institution under resolution or provided by other sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to Article 37(7), any consideration paid by the bridge institution shall benefit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When applying the bridge institution tool, the resolution authority may exercise the transfer power more than once in order to make supplemental transfers of shares or other instruments of ownership issued by an institution under resolution or, as the case may be, assets, rights or liabilities of the institution under resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an application of the bridge institution tool, the resolution authority may:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the possibility that the specific shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities might be transferred back is stated expressly in the instrument by which the transfer was made;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the specific shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities do not in fact fall within the classes of, or meet the conditions for transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities specified in the instrument by which the transfer was made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Such a transfer back may be made within any period, and shall comply with any other conditions, stated in that instrument for the relevant purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfers between the institution under resolution, or the original owners of shares or other instruments of ownership, on the one hand, and the bridge institution on the other, shall be subject to the safeguards referred to in Chapter VII of Title IV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of exercising the rights to provide services or to establish itself in another Member State in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU, a bridge institution shall be considered to be a continuation of the institution under resolution, and may continue to exercise any such right that was exercised by the institution under resolution in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities transferred.&lt;br&gt;For other purposes, resolution authorities may require that a bridge institution be considered to be a continuation of the institution under resolution, and be able to continue to exercise any right that was exercised by the institution under resolution in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities transferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that the bridge institution may continue to exercise the rights of membership and access to payment, clearing and settlement systems, stock exchanges, investor compensation schemes and deposit guarantee schemes of the institution under resolution, provided that it meets the membership and participation criteria for participation in such systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, Member States shall ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority approves the remuneration of the members of the management body and determines their appropriate responsibilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority approves the strategy and risk profile of the bridge institution;&lt;/li&gt;

To that end, the resolution authority shall submit a request in that sense to the competent authority. If the competent authority decides to grant such an authorisation, it shall indicate the period for which the bridge institution is waived from complying with the requirements of those Directives.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the bridge institution’s assets are completely wound down and its liabilities are completely discharged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure, in cases when the resolution authority seeks to sell the bridge institution or its assets, rights or liabilities, that the bridge institution or the relevant assets or liabilities are marketed openly and transparently, and that the sale does not materially misrepresent them or unduly favour or discriminate between potential purchasers.&lt;br&gt;Any such sale shall be made on commercial terms, having regard to the circumstances and in accordance with the Union State aid framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If none of the outcomes referred to in points (a), (b), (c) and (e) of paragraph 3 applies, the resolution authority shall terminate the operation of a bridge institution as soon as possible and in any event two years after the date on which the last transfer from an institution under resolution pursuant to the bridge institution tool was made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution authority may extend the period referred to in paragraph 5 for one or more additional one-year periods where such an extension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports the outcomes referred to in point (a), (b), (c) or (e) of paragraph 3; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is necessary to ensure the continuity of essential banking or financial services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any decision of the resolution authority to extend the period referred to in paragraph 5 shall be reasoned and shall contain a detailed assessment of the situation, including of the market conditions and outlook, that justifies the extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the operations of a bridge institution are terminated in the circumstances referred to in point (c) or (d) of paragraph 3, the bridge institution shall be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.&lt;br&gt;Subject to Article 37(7), any proceeds generated as a result of the termination of the operation of the bridge institution shall benefit the shareholders of the bridge institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a bridge institution is used for the purpose of transferring assets and liabilities of more than one institution under resolution the obligation referred to in paragraph 8 shall refer to the assets and liabilities transferred from each of the institutions under resolution and not to the bridge institution itself.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In order to give effect to the asset separation tool, Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to transfer assets, rights or liabilities of an institution under resolution or a bridge institution to one or more asset management vehicles.&lt;br&gt;Subject to Article 85, the transfer referred to in the first subparagraph may take place without obtaining the consent of the shareholders of the institutions under resolution or any third party other than the bridge institution, and without complying with any procedural requirements under company or securities law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the asset separation tool, an asset management vehicle shall be a legal person that meets all of the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is wholly or partially owned by one or more public authorities which may include the resolution authority or the resolution financing arrangement and is controlled by the resolution authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has been created for the purpose of receiving some or all of the assets, rights and liabilities of one or more institutions under resolution or a bridge institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The asset management vehicle shall manage the assets transferred to it with a view to maximising their value through eventual sale or orderly wind down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that the operation of an asset management vehicle respects the following provisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contents of the asset management vehicle’s constitutional documents are approved by the resolution authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subject to the asset management vehicle’s ownership structure, the resolution authority either appoints or approves the vehicle’s management body;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority approves the remuneration of the members of the management body and determines their appropriate responsibilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority approves the strategy and risk profile of the asset management vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution authorities may exercise the power specified in paragraph 1 to transfer assets, rights or liabilities only if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the situation of the particular market for those assets is of such a nature that the liquidation of those assets under normal insolvency proceedings could have an adverse effect on one or more financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such a transfer is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the institution under resolution or bridge institution; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such a transfer is necessary to maximise liquidation proceeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When applying the asset separation tool, resolution authorities shall determine the consideration for which assets, rights and liabilities are transferred to the asset management vehicle in accordance with the principles established in Article 36 and in accordance with the Union State aid framework. This paragraph does not prevent the consideration having nominal or negative value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject to Article 37(7), any consideration paid by the asset management vehicle in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities acquired directly from the institution under resolution shall benefit the institution under resolution. Consideration may be paid in the form of debt issued by the asset management vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the bridge institution tool has been applied, an asset management vehicle may, subsequent to the application of the bridge institution tool, acquire assets, rights or liabilities from the bridge institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolution authorities may transfer assets, rights or liabilities from the institution under resolution to one or more asset management vehicles on more than one occasion and transfer assets, rights or liabilities back from one or more asset management vehicles to the institution under resolution provided that the conditions specified in paragraph 10 are met.&lt;br&gt;The institution under resolution shall be obliged to take back any such assets, rights or liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution authorities may transfer rights, assets or liabilities back from the asset management vehicle to the institution under resolution in one of the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the possibility that the specific rights, assets or liabilities might be transferred back is stated expressly in the instrument by which the transfer was made;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the specific rights, assets or liabilities do not in fact fall within the classes of, or meet the conditions for transfer of, rights, assets or liabilities specified in the instrument by which the transfer was made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;In either of the cases referred in points (a) and (b), the transfer back may be made within any period, and shall comply with any other conditions, stated in that instrument for the relevant purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfers between the institution under resolution and the asset management vehicle shall be subject to the safeguards for partial property transfers specified in Chapter VII of Title IV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to Chapter VII of Title IV shareholders or creditors of the institution under resolution and other third parties whose assets, rights or liabilities are not transferred to the asset management vehicle shall not have any rights over or in relation to the assets, rights or liabilities transferred to the asset management vehicle or its management body or senior management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objectives of an asset management vehicle shall not imply any duty or responsibility to shareholders or creditors of the institution under resolution, and the management body or senior management shall have no liability to such shareholders or creditors for acts and omissions in the discharge of their duties unless the act or omission implies gross negligence or serious misconduct in accordance with national law which directly affects rights of such shareholders or creditors.&lt;br&gt;Member States may further limit the liability of an asset management vehicle and its management body or senior management in accordance with national law for acts and omissions in the discharge of their duties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall, by 3 July 2015, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to promote the convergence of supervisory and resolution practices regarding the determination when, in accordance to paragraph 5 of this Article the liquidation of the assets or liabilities under normal insolvency proceeding could have an adverse effect on one or more financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;to recapitalise an institution or an entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) of this Directive that meets the conditions for resolution to the extent sufficient to restore its ability to comply with the conditions for authorisation (to the extent that those conditions apply to the entity) and to continue to carry out the activities for which it is authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU, where the entity is authorised under those Directives, and to sustain sufficient market confidence in the institution or entity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to convert to equity or reduce the principal amount of claims or debt instruments that are transferred:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;under the sale of business tool or the asset separation tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may apply the bail-in tool for the purpose referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 of this Article only if there is a reasonable prospect that the application of that tool together with other relevant measures including measures implemented in accordance with the business reorganisation plan required by Article 52 will, in addition to achieving relevant resolution objectives, restore the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) in question to financial soundness and long-term viability.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may apply any of the resolution tools referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 37(3), and the bail-in tool referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article, where the conditions laid down in the first subparagraph are not met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may apply the bail-in tool to all institutions or entities referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) while respecting in each case the legal form of the institution or entity concerned or may change the legal form.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution authorities shall not exercise the write down or conversion powers in relation to the following liabilities whether they are governed by the law of a Member State or of a third country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;covered deposits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secured liabilities including covered bonds and liabilities in the form of financial instruments used for hedging purposes which form an integral part of the cover pool and which according to national law are secured in a way similar to covered bonds;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any liability that arises by virtue of the holding by the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) of this Directive of client assets or client money including client assets or client money held on behalf of UCITS as defined in Article 1(2) of Directive 2009/65/EC or of AIFs as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the CouncilDirective 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010 (OJ L 174, 1.7.2011, p. 1)., provided that such a client is protected under the applicable insolvency law;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any liability that arises by virtue of a fiduciary relationship between the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) (as fiduciary) and another person (as beneficiary) provided that such a beneficiary is protected under the applicable insolvency or civil law;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liabilities to institutions, excluding entities that are part of the same group, with an original maturity of less than seven days;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liabilities with a remaining maturity of less than seven days, owed to systems or operators of systems designated in accordance with Directive 98/26/EC or to their participants and arising from the participation in such a system, or to CCPs authorised in the Union pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and third-country CCPs recognised by ESMA pursuant to Article 25 of that Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a liability to any one of the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an employee, in relation to accrued salary, pension benefits or other fixed remuneration, except for the variable component of remuneration that is not regulated by a collective bargaining agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a commercial or trade creditor arising from the provision to the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) of goods or services that are critical to the daily functioning of its operations, including IT services, utilities and the rental, servicing and upkeep of premises;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tax and social security authorities, provided that those liabilities are preferred under the applicable law;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deposit guarantee schemes arising from contributions due in accordance with Directive 2014/49/EU;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liabilities to institutions or entities referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) that are part of the same resolution group without being themselves resolution entities, regardless of their maturities, except where those liabilities rank below ordinary unsecured liabilities under the relevant national law governing normal insolvency proceedings applicable on the date of transposition of this Directive; in cases where that exception applies, the resolution authority of the relevant subsidiary that is not a resolution entity shall assess whether the amount of items complying with Article 45f(2) is sufficient to support the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Point (g)(i) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the variable component of the remuneration of material risk takers as identified in Article 92(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;br&gt;Member States shall ensure that all secured assets relating to a covered bond cover pool remain unaffected, segregated and with enough funding. Neither that requirement nor point (b) of the first subparagraph shall prevent resolution authorities, where appropriate, from exercising those powers in relation to any part of a secured liability or a liability for which collateral has been pledged that exceeds the value of the assets, pledge, lien or collateral against which it is secured.&lt;br&gt;Point (a) of the first subparagraph shall not prevent resolution authorities, where appropriate, from exercising those powers in relation to any amount of a deposit that exceeds the coverage level provided for in Article 6 of Directive 2014/49/EU.&lt;br&gt;Without prejudice to the large exposure rules in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU, Member States shall ensure that in order to provide for the resolvability of institutions and groups, resolution authorities limit, in accordance with point (b) of Article 17(5) of this Directive, the extent to which other institutions hold bail-inable liabilities, save for liabilities that are held at entities that are part of the same group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exceptional circumstances, where the bail-in tool is applied, the resolution authority may exclude or partially exclude certain liabilities from the application of the write-down or conversion powers where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not possible to bail-in that liability within a reasonable time notwithstanding the good faith efforts of the resolution authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exclusion is strictly necessary and is proportionate to achieve the continuity of critical functions and core business lines in a manner that maintains the ability of the institution under resolution to continue key operations, services and transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, in particular as regards eligible deposits held by natural persons and micro, small and medium sized enterprises, which would severely disrupt the functioning of financial markets, including of financial market infrastructures, in a manner that could cause a serious disturbance to the economy of a Member State or of the Union; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the application of the bail-in tool to those liabilities would cause a destruction in value such that the losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if those liabilities were excluded from bail-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Resolution authorities shall carefully assess whether liabilities to institutions or entities referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) that are part of the same resolution group without being themselves resolution entities and that are not excluded from the application of the write down and conversion powers under point (h) of paragraph (2) of this Article should be excluded or partially excluded under points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph to ensure the effective implementation of the resolution strategy.&lt;br&gt;Where a resolution authority decides to exclude or partially exclude a bail-inable liability or class of bail-inable liabilities under this paragraph, the level of write down or conversion applied to other bail-inable liabilities may be increased to take account of such exclusions, provided that the level of write down and conversion applied to other bail-inable liabilities complies with the principle in point (g) of Article 34(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a resolution authority decides to exclude or partially exclude a bail-inable liability or class of bail-inable liabilities pursuant to this Article, and the losses that would have been borne by those liabilities have not been passed on fully to other creditors, the resolution financing arrangement may make a contribution to the institution under resolution to do one or both of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cover any losses which have not been absorbed by bail-inable liabilities and restore the net asset value of the institution under resolution to zero in accordance with point (a) of Article 46(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase shares or other instruments of ownership or capital instruments in the institution under resolution, in order to recapitalise the institution in accordance with point (b) of Article 46(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution financing arrangement may make a contribution referred to in paragraph 4 only where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation equal to an amount not less than 8 % of the total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution, measured at the time of resolution action in accordance with the valuation provided for in Article 36, has been made by the shareholders and the holders of other instruments of ownership, the holders of relevant capital instruments and other bail-inable liabilities through write down, conversion or otherwise; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contribution of the resolution financing arrangement does not exceed 5 % of the total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution, measured at the time of resolution action in accordance with the valuation provided for in Article 36.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contribution of the resolution financing arrangement referred to in paragraph 4 may be financed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount available to the resolution financing arrangement which has been raised through contributions by institutions and Union branches in accordance with Article 100(6) and Article 103;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount that can be raised through ex-post contributions in accordance with Article 104 within three years; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the amounts referred to (a) and (b) of this paragraph are insufficient, amounts raised from alternative financing sources in accordance with Article 105.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In extraordinary circumstances, the resolution authority may seek further funding from alternative financing sources after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 5 % limit specified in paragraph 5(b) has been reached; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all unsecured, non-preferred liabilities, other than eligible deposits, have been written down or converted in full.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;As an alternative or in addition, where the conditions laid down in the first subparagraph are met, the resolution financing arrangement may make a contribution from resources which have been raised through ex-ante contributions in accordance with Article 100(6) and Article 103 and which have not yet been used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of derogation from paragraph 5 (a), the resolution financing arrangement may also make a contribution as referred to in paragraph 4 provided that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 is equal to an amount not less than 20 % of the risk weighted assets of the institution concerned;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution financing arrangement of the Member State concerned has at its disposal, by way of ex-ante contributions (not including contributions to a deposit guarantee scheme) raised in accordance with Article 100(6) and Article 103, an amount which is at least equal to 3 % of covered deposits of all the credit institutions authorised in the territory of that Member State; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution concerned has assets below EUR 900 billion on a consolidated basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When exercising the discretions under paragraph 3, resolution authorities shall give due consideration to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principle that losses should be borne first by shareholders and next, in general, by creditors of the institution under resolution in order of preference;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the level of loss absorbing capacity that would remain in the institution under resolution if the liability or class of liabilities were excluded; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to maintain adequate resources for resolution financing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusions under paragraph 3 may be applied either to completely exclude a liability from write down or to limit the extent of the write down applied to that liability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 in order to specify further the circumstances when exclusion is necessary to achieve the objectives specified in paragraph 3 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before exercising the discretion to exclude a liability under paragraph 3, the resolution authority shall notify the Commission. Where the exclusion would require a contribution by the resolution financing arrangement or an alternative financing source under paragraphs 4 to 8, the Commission may, within 24 hours of receipt of such a notification, or a longer period with the agreement of the resolution authority, prohibit or require amendments to the proposed exclusion if the requirements of this Article and delegated acts are not met in order to protect the integrity of the internal market. This is without prejudice to the application by the Commission of the Union State aid framework.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Article 72c.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, where this Directive refers to the requirements in Article 92a or Article 92b of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for the purpose of those Articles, eligible liabilities shall consist of eligible liabilities as defined in Article 72k of that Regulation and determined in accordance with Chapter 5a of Title I of Part Two of that Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liabilities that arise from debt instruments with embedded derivatives, such as structured notes, that meet the conditions of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, except for point (l) of Article 72a(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, shall be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities only where one of the following conditions is met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal amount of the liability arising from the debt instrument is known at the time of issue, is fixed or increasing, and is not affected by an embedded derivative feature, and the total amount of the liability arising from the debt instrument, including the embedded derivative, can be valued on a daily basis by reference to an active and liquid two-way market for an equivalent instrument without credit risk, in accordance with Articles 104 and 105 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the debt instrument includes a contractual term that specifies that the value of the claim in cases of the insolvency of the issuer and of the resolution of the issuer is fixed or increasing, and does not exceed the initially paid-up amount of the liability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Debt instruments referred to in the first subparagraph, including their embedded derivatives, shall not be subject to any netting agreement and the valuation of such instruments shall not be subject to Article 49(3).&lt;br&gt;The liabilities referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities with respect to the part of the liability that corresponds to the principal amount referred to in point (a) of that subparagraph or to the fixed or increasing amount referred to in point (b) of that subparagraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where liabilities are issued by a subsidiary established in the Union to an existing shareholder that is not part of the same resolution group, and that subsidiary is part of the same resolution group as the resolution entity, those liabilities shall be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities of that resolution entity, provided that all of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are issued in accordance with point (a) of Article 45f(2);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exercise of the write down or conversion power in relation to those liabilities in accordance with Articles 59 or 62 does not affect the control of the subsidiary by the resolution entity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those liabilities do not exceed an amount determined by subtracting:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sum of the liabilities issued to and bought by the resolution entity either directly or indirectly through other entities in the same resolution group and the amount of own funds issued in accordance with point (b) of Article 45f(2) from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount required in accordance with Article 45f(1).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without prejudice to the minimum requirement in Article 45c(5) or point (a) of Article 45d(1), resolution authorities shall ensure that a part of the requirement referred to in Article 45e equal to 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, shall be met by resolution entities that are G-SIIs or resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article. The resolution authority may permit that a level lower than 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, but greater than the amount resulting from the application of the formula (1-(X1/X2)) × 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, shall be met by resolution entities that are G-SIIs or resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred in paragraph 3 of this Article, provided that all the conditions set out in Article 72b(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 are met, where, in light of the reduction that is possible under Article 72b(3) of that Regulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrListNoStyle&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;X1 = 3,5 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;X2 = the sum of 18 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the amount of the combined buffer requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5), where the application of the first subparagraph of this paragraph leads to a requirement greater than 27 % of the total risk exposure amount, for the resolution entity concerned, the resolution authority shall limit the part of the requirement referred to in Article 45e which is to be met using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, to an amount equal to 27 % of the total risk exposure amount, if the resolution authority has assessed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access to the resolution financing arrangement is not considered to be an option for resolving that resolution entity in the resolution plan; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where point (a) does not apply, the requirement referred to in Article 45e allows that resolution entity to meet the requirements referred to in Article 44(5) or 44(8) as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;In carrying out the assessment referred to in the second subparagraph, the resolution authority shall also take into account the risk of disproportionate impact on the business model of the resolution entity concerned.&lt;br&gt;For resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(6), the second subparagraph of this paragraph does not apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resolution entities that are neither G-SIIs nor resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6), the resolution authority may decide that a part of the requirement referred to in Article 45e up to the greater of 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, of the entity and the formula referred to in paragraph 7, shall be met using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, provided that the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-subordinated liabilities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article have the same priority ranking in the national insolvency hierarchy as certain liabilities that are excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or Article 44(3);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a risk that, as a result of a planned application of write-down and conversion powers to non-subordinated liabilities that are not excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or Article 44(3), creditors whose claims arise from those liabilities incur greater losses than they would incur in a winding up under normal insolvency proceedings;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of own funds and other subordinated liabilities does not exceed the amount necessary to ensure that the creditors referred to in point (b) do not incur losses above the level of losses that they would otherwise have incurred in the winding-up under normal insolvency proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where the resolution authority determines that, within a class of liabilities which includes eligible liabilities, the amount of the liabilities that are excluded or reasonably likely to be excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or Article 44(3) totals more than 10 % of that class, the resolution authority shall assess the risk referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of paragraphs 4, 5 and 7, derivative liabilities shall be included in total liabilities on the basis that full recognition is given to counterparty netting rights.&lt;br&gt;The own funds of a resolution entity that are used to comply with the combined buffer requirement shall be eligible to comply with the requirements referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By derogation from paragraph 4 of this Article, the resolution authority may decide that the requirement referred to in Article 45e of this Directive shall be met by resolution entities that are G-SIIs or resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) of this Directive using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, to the extent that, due to the obligation of the resolution entity to comply with the combined buffer requirement and the requirements referred to in Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Article 45c(5) and Article 45 e of this Directive, the sum of those own funds, instruments and liabilities does not exceed the greater of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 % of total liabilities, including own funds, of the entity; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount resulting from the application of the formula Ax2+Bx2+C, where A, B and C are the following amounts:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrListNoStyle&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A = the amount resulting from the requirement referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;B = the amount resulting from the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C = the amount resulting from the combined buffer requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolution authorities may exercise the power referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article with respect to resolution entities that are G-SIIs or that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6), and that meet one of the conditions set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph, up to a limit of 30 % of the total number of all resolution entities that are G-SIIs or that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) for which the resolution authority determines the requirement referred to in Article 45e.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conditions shall be considered by resolution authorities as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substantive impediments to resolvability have been identified in the preceding resolvability assessment and either:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no remedial action has been taken following the application of the measures referred to in Article 17(5) in the timeline required by the resolution authority, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the identified substantive impediments cannot be addressed using any of the measures referred to in Article 17(5), and the exercise of the power referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article would partially or fully compensate for the negative impact of the substantive impediments on resolvability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution authority considers that the feasibility and credibility of the resolution entity&#x27;s preferred resolution strategy is limited, taking into account the entity&#x27;s size, its interconnectedness, the nature, scope, risk and complexity of its activities, its legal status and its shareholding structure; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU reflects the fact that the resolution entity that is a G-SII or that is subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) of this Directive is, in terms of riskiness, among the top 20 % of institutions for which the resolution authority determines the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) of this Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of the percentages referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, the resolution authority shall round the number resulting from the calculation up to the closest whole number.&lt;br&gt;Member States may, by taking into account the specificities of their national banking sector, including in particular the number of resolution entities that are G-SIIs or that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) for which the national resolution authority determines the requirement referred to in Article 45e, set the percentage referred to in the first subparagraph at a level higher than 30 %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resolution authority shall only take the decisions referred to in paragraph 5 or 7 after consulting the competent authority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When taking those decisions, the resolution authority shall also take into account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the depth of the market for the resolution entity&#x27;s own funds instruments and subordinated eligible instruments, the pricing of such instruments, where they exist, and the time needed to execute any transactions necessary for the purpose of complying with the decision;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of eligible liabilities instruments that meet all of the conditions referred to in Article 72a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 that have a residual maturity below one year as of the date of the decision, with a view to making quantitative adjustments to the requirements referred to in paragraphs 5 and 7 of this Article;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the availability and the amount of instruments that meet all of the conditions referred to in Article 72a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 other than point (d) of Article 72b(2) of that Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the amount of liabilities that are excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or (3) and that, in normal insolvency proceedings, rank equally with or below the highest ranking eligible liabilities is significant in comparison to the own funds and eligible liabilities of the resolution entity. Where the amount of excluded liabilities does not exceed 5 % of the amount of the own funds and eligible liabilities of the resolution entity, the excluded amount shall be considered as not being significant. Above that threshold, the significance of the excluded liabilities shall be assessed by resolution authorities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution entity&#x27;s business model, funding model, and risk profile, as well as its stability and ability to contribute to the economy; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the impact of possible restructuring costs on the resolution entity&#x27;s recapitalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be determined by the resolution authority, after consulting the competent authority, on the basis of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to ensure that the resolution group can be resolved by the application of the resolution tools to the resolution entity, including, where appropriate, the bail-in tool, in a way that meets the resolution objectives;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to ensure, where appropriate, that the resolution entity and its subsidiaries that are institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) but are not resolution entities have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities to ensure that, if the bail-in tool or write down and conversion powers, respectively, were to be applied to them, losses could be absorbed and that it is possible to restore the total capital ratio and, as applicable, the leverage ratio, of the relevant entities to a level necessary to enable them to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to carry on the activities for which they are authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to ensure, if the resolution plan anticipates the possibility for certain classes of eligible liabilities to be excluded from bail-in pursuant to Article 44(3) of this Directive or to be transferred in full to a recipient under a partial transfer, that the resolution entity has sufficient own funds and other eligible liabilities to absorb losses and to restore its total capital ratio and, as applicable, its leverage ratio, to the level necessary to enable it to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to carry on the activities for which it is authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size, the business model, the funding model and the risk profile of the entity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent to which the failure of the entity would have an adverse effect on financial stability, including through contagion to other institutions or entities, due to the interconnectedness of the entity with those other institutions or entities or with the rest of the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the resolution plan provides that resolution action is to be taken or that the power to write down and convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 is to be exercised in accordance with the relevant scenario referred to in Article 10(3), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall equal an amount sufficient to ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the losses that are expected to be incurred by the entity are fully absorbed (loss absorption);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the resolution entity and its subsidiaries that are institutions or entities referred to points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) but are not resolution entities are recapitalised to a level necessary to enable them to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation, and to carry on the activities for which they are authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU, Directive 2014/65/EU or an equivalent legislative act for an appropriate period not longer than one year (recapitalisation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where the resolution plan provides that the entity is to be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings or other equivalent national procedures, the resolution authority shall assess whether it is justified to limit the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) for that entity, so that it does not exceed an amount sufficient to absorb losses in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph.&lt;br&gt;The assessment by the resolution authority shall, in particular, evaluate the limit referred to in the second subparagraph as regards any possible impact on financial stability and on the risk of contagion to the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resolution entities, the amount referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the purpose of calculating the requirement referred to in Article 45(1), in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2), the sum of:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of the losses to be absorbed in resolution that corresponds to the requirements referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU of the resolution entity at the consolidated resolution group level; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a recapitalisation amount that allows the resolution group resulting from resolution to restore compliance with its total capital ratio requirement referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and its requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU at the consolidated resolution group level after the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the purpose of calculating the requirement referred to in Article 45(1), in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2), the sum of:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of the losses to be absorbed in resolution that corresponds to the resolution entity&#x27;s leverage ratio requirement referred to in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 at the consolidated resolution group level; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a recapitalisation amount that allows the resolution group resulting from resolution to restore compliance with the leverage ratio requirement referred to in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 at the consolidated resolution group level after the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of point (a) of Article 45(2), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be expressed in percentage terms as the amount calculated in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, divided by the total risk exposure amount.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of point (b) of Article 45(2), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be expressed in percentage terms as the amount calculated in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, divided by the total exposure measure.&lt;br&gt;When setting the individual requirement provided in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the resolution authority shall take into account the requirements referred to in Articles 37(10), 44(5) and 44(8).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When setting the recapitalisation amounts referred to in the previous subparagraphs, the resolution authority shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the most recently reported values for the relevant total risk exposure amount or total exposure measure, adjusted for any changes resulting from resolution actions set out in the resolution plan; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after consulting the competent authority, adjust the amount corresponding to the current requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU downwards or upwards to determine the requirement that is to apply to the resolution entity after the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The resolution authority shall be able to increase the requirement provided in point (a)(ii) of the first subparagraph by an appropriate amount necessary to ensure that, following resolution, the entity is able to sustain sufficient market confidence for an appropriate period, which shall not exceed one year.&lt;br&gt;Where the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph applies, the amount referred to in that subparagraph shall be equal to the combined buffer requirement that is to apply after the application of the resolution tools, less the amount referred to in point (a) of point (6) of Article 128 of Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;br&gt;The amount referred to in the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adjusted downwards if, after consulting the competent authority, the resolution authority determines that it would be feasible and credible for a lower amount to be sufficient to sustain market confidence and to ensure both the continued provision of critical economic functions by the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) and its access to funding without recourse to extraordinary public financial support other than contributions from resolution financing arrangements, in accordance with Article 44(5) and (8) and Article 101(2), after implementation of the resolution strategy. That amount shall be adjusted upwards if, after consulting the competent authority, the resolution authority determines that a higher amount is necessary to sustain sufficient market confidence and to ensure both the continued provision of critical economic functions by the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) and its access to funding without recourse to extraordinary public financial support other than contributions from resolution financing arrangements, in accordance with Article 44(5) and (8) and Article 101(2), for an appropriate period which shall not exceed one year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the methodology to be used by resolution authorities to estimate the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU and the combined buffer requirement for resolution entities at the resolution group consolidated level where the resolution group is not subject to those requirements under that Directive.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resolution entities that are not subject to Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and that are part of a resolution group the total assets of which exceed EUR 100 billion, the level of the requirement referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be at least equal to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13,5 % when calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 % when calculated in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;By way of derogation from Article 45b, the resolution entities referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall meet a level of the requirement referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph that is equal to 13,5 % when calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2) and to 5 % when calculated in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2) using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in Article 45b(3) of this Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A resolution authority may, after consulting the competent authority, decide to apply the requirements laid down in paragraph 5 of this Article to a resolution entity which is not subject to Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which is part of a resolution group the total assets of which are lower than EUR 100 billion and which the resolution authority has assessed as reasonably likely to pose a systemic risk in the event of its failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When taking a decision as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, a resolution authority shall take into account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the prevalence of deposits, and the absence of debt instruments, in the funding model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent to which access to the capital markets for eligible liabilities is limited;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent to which the resolution entity relies on Common Equity Tier 1 capital to meet the requirement referred to in Article 45e.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The absence of a decision pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph is without prejudice to any decision under Article 45b(5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For entities that are not themselves resolution entities, the amount referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When applying the write down or conversion powers, resolution authorities shall allocate the losses represented by the sum of the amounts referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 47(3) equally between shares or other instruments of ownership and bail-inable liabilities of the same rank by reducing the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, those shares or other instruments of ownership and bail-inable liabilities to the same extent pro rata to their value except where a different allocation of losses amongst liabilities of the same rank is allowed in the circumstances specified in Article 44(3).&lt;br&gt;This paragraph shall not prevent liabilities which have been excluded from bail-in in accordance with Article 44(2) and (3) from receiving more favourable treatment than bail-inable liabilities which are of the same rank in normal insolvency proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before applying the write down or conversion referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, resolution authorities shall convert or reduce the principal amount on instruments referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 when those instruments contain the following terms and have not already been converted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;terms that provide for the principal amount of the instrument to be reduced on the occurrence of any event that refers to the financial situation, solvency or levels of own funds of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;terms that provide for the conversion of the instruments to shares or other instruments of ownership on the occurrence of any such event.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the principal amount of an instrument has been reduced, but not to zero, in accordance with terms of the kind referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3 before the application of the bail-in pursuant to paragraph 1, resolution authorities shall apply the write-down and conversion powers to the residual amount of that principal in accordance with paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When deciding on whether liabilities are to be written down or converted into equity, resolution authorities shall not convert one class of liabilities, while a class of liabilities that is subordinated to that class remains substantially unconverted into equity or not written down, unless otherwise permitted under Article 44(2) and (3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of this Article, EBA shall, by 3 January 2016, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 for any interpretation relating to the interrelationship between the provisions of this Directive and those of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that, for entities referred to in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 1(1), all claims resulting from own funds items have, in national laws governing normal insolvency proceedings, a lower priority ranking than any claim that does not result from an own funds item.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of the first subparagraph, to the extent that an instrument is only partly recognised as an own funds item, the whole instrument shall be treated as a claim resulting from an own funds item and shall rank lower than any claim that does not result from an own funds item.&lt;/li&gt;

Upon entry into resolution, resolution authorities shall be empowered to terminate and close out any derivative contract for that purpose.&lt;br&gt;Where a derivative liability has been excluded from the application of the bail-in tool under Article 44(3), resolution authorities shall not be obliged to terminate or close out the derivative contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where derivative transactions are subject to a netting agreement, the resolution authority or an independent valuer shall determine as part of the valuation under Article 36 the liability arising from those transactions on a net basis in accordance with the terms of the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;EBA, after consulting the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying methodologies and the principles referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 on the valuation of liabilities arising from derivatives.&lt;br&gt;In relation to derivative transactions that are subject to a netting agreement, EBA shall take into account the methodology for close-out set out in the netting agreement.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 January 2016.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The conversion rate shall represent appropriate compensation to the affected creditor for any loss incurred by virtue of the exercise of the write down and conversion powers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When different conversion rates are applied according to paragraph 1, the conversion rate applicable to liabilities that are considered to be senior under applicable insolvency law shall be higher than the conversion rate applicable to subordinated liabilities.&lt;/li&gt;

The group-level resolution authority shall communicate the plan to other resolution authorities concerned and to EBA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In exceptional circumstances, and if it is necessary for achieving the resolution objectives, the resolution authority may extend the period in paragraph 1 up to a maximum of two months since the application of the bail-in tool.&lt;br&gt;Where the business reorganisation plan is required to be notified within the Union State aid framework, the resolution authority may extend the period in paragraph 1 up to a maximum of two months since the application of the bail-in tool or until the deadline laid down by the Union State aid framework, whichever occurs earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A business reorganisation plan shall set out measures aiming to restore the long-term viability of the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) or parts of its business within a reasonable timescale. Those measures shall be based on realistic assumptions as to the economic and financial market conditions under which the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) will operate.&lt;br&gt;The business reorganisation plan shall take account, inter alia, of the current state and future prospects of the financial markets, reflecting best-case and worst-case assumptions, including a combination of events allowing the identification of the institution’s main vulnerabilities.

&lt;li&gt;Where a resolution action is taken in relation to a resolution entity or, in exceptional circumstances in deviation from the resolution plan, in relation to an entity that is not a resolution entity, the amount that is reduced, written down or converted in accordance with Article 60(1) at the level of such an entity shall count towards the thresholds laid down in Articles 37(10) and point (a) of Article 44(5), or point (a) of Article 44(8) that apply to the entity concerned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that the resolution authorities have the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments, and eligible liabilities as referred to in paragraph 1a, into shares or other instruments of ownership of institutions and entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;where the determination has been made that the conditions for resolution specified in Articles 32, 32a, or 33 have been met, before any resolution action is taken;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the appropriate authority determines that unless that power is exercised in relation to the relevant capital instruments, and eligible liabilities as referred to in paragraph 1a, the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) will no longer be viable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of relevant capital instruments issued by a subsidiary and where those capital instruments are recognised for the purposes of meeting own funds requirements on an individual and on a consolidated basis, the appropriate authority of the Member State of the consolidating supervisor and the appropriate authority of the Member State of the subsidiary make a joint determination taking the form of a joint decision in accordance with Article 92(3) and (4) that unless the write down or conversion power is exercised in relation to those instruments, the group will no longer be viable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of relevant capital instruments issued at the level of the parent undertaking and where those capital instruments are recognised for the purposes of meeting own funds requirements on an individual basis at the level of the parent undertaking or on a consolidated basis, and the appropriate authority of the Member State of the consolidating supervisor makes a determination that unless the write down or conversion power is exercised in relation to those instruments, the group will no longer be viable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extraordinary public financial support is required by the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) except in any of the circumstances set out in point (d)(iii) of Article 32(4).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 4 of this Article, an institution or an entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) shall be deemed to be failing or likely to fail where one or more of the circumstances set out in Article 32(4) occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 4, a group shall be deemed to be failing or likely to fail where the group infringes or there are objective elements to support a determination that the group, in the near future, will infringe its consolidated prudential requirements in a way that would justify action by the competent authority including but not limited to because the group has incurred or is likely to incur losses that will deplete all or a significant amount of its own funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A relevant capital instrument issued by a subsidiary shall not be written down to a greater extent or converted on worse terms pursuant to point (c) of paragraph 3 than equally ranked capital instruments at the level of the parent undertaking which have been written down or converted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an appropriate authority makes a determination referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, it shall immediately notify the resolution authority responsible for the institution or for the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) in question, if different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before making a determination referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3of this Article in relation to a subsidiary that issues relevant capital instruments that are recognised for the purposes of meeting the own funds requirements on an individual and on a consolidated basis, the appropriate authority shall comply with the notification and consultation requirements laid down in Article 62.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before exercising the power to write down or convert capital instruments, or eligible liabilities as referred to in paragraph 1a, resolution authorities shall ensure that a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) is carried out in accordance with Article 36. That valuation shall form the basis of the calculation of the write down to be applied to the relevant capital instruments, or eligible liabilities as referred to in paragraph 1a in order to absorb losses and the level of conversion to be applied to relevant capital instruments, or eligible liabilities as referred to in paragraph 1a in order to recapitalise the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Equity Tier 1 items are reduced first in proportion to the losses and to the extent of their capacity and the resolution authority takes one or both of the actions specified in Article 47(1) in respect of holders of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal amount of Additional Tier 1 instruments is written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives set out in Article 31 or to the extent of the capacity of the relevant capital instruments, whichever is lower;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal amount of Tier 2 instruments is written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives set out in Article 31 or to the extent of the capacity of the relevant capital instruments, whichever is lower;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal amount of eligible liabilities referred to in Article 59(1a) is written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives set out in Article 31 or to the extent of the capacity of the relevant eligible liabilities, whichever is lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the principal amount of a relevant capital instrument, or an eligible liability as referred to in Article 59(1a) is written down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reduction of that principal amount shall be permanent, subject to any write up in accordance with the reimbursement mechanism in Article 46(3);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no liability to the holder of the relevant capital instrument, or of the eligible liability as referred to in Article 59(1a), shall remain under or in connection with that amount of the instrument, which has been written down, except for any liability already accrued, and any liability for damages that may arise as a result of an appeal challenging the legality of the exercise of the write down power;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no compensation is paid to any holder of the relevant capital instruments, or of the liabilities as referred to in Article 59(1a), other than in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to effect a conversion of relevant capital instruments, and eligible liabilities as referred to in Article 59(1a), under points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, resolution authorities may require institutions and entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) to issue Common Equity Tier 1 instruments to the holders of the relevant capital instruments and such eligible liabilities. Relevant capital instruments and such liabilities may only be converted where the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those Common Equity Tier 1 instruments are issued by the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) or by a parent undertaking of the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), with the agreement of the resolution authority of the institution or the entity referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) or, where relevant, of the resolution authority of the parent undertaking;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those Common Equity Tier 1 instruments are issued prior to any issuance of shares or other instruments of ownership by that institution or that entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) for the purposes of provision of own funds by the State or a government entity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those Common Equity Tier 1 instruments are awarded and transferred without delay following the exercise of the conversion power;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the conversion rate that determines the number of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that are provided in respect of each relevant capital instrument, or each eligible liability as referred to in Article 59(1a) complies with the principles set out in Article 50 and any guidelines developed by EBA pursuant to Article 50(4).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;Where the joint decision on the recognition of the third-country resolution proceedings is reached, respective national resolution authorities shall seek the enforcement of the recognised third-country resolution proceedings in accordance with their national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the absence of a joint decision between the resolution authorities participating in the European resolution college, or in the absence of a European resolution college, each resolution authority concerned shall make its own decision on whether to recognise and enforce, except as provided for in Article 95, third-country resolution proceedings relating to a third-country institution or a parent undertaking.&lt;br&gt;The decision shall give due consideration to the interests of each individual Member State where a third-country institution or parent undertaking operates, and in particular to the potential impact of the recognition and enforcement of the third-country resolution proceedings on the other parts of the group and the financial stability in those Member States.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Resolution authorities may take, where necessary in the public interest, resolution action with respect to a parent undertaking where the relevant third-country authority determines that an institution that is incorporated in that third country meets the conditions for resolution under the law of that third country. To that end, Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities are empowered to use any resolution power in respect of that parent undertaking, and Article 68 shall apply.&lt;/li&gt;
