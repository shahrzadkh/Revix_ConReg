&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A criterion set out in paragraph 1 shall not be deemed to be met where the institution determines that the professional activities of the staff member do not have a material impact on the institution&#x27;s risk profile because the staff member, or the category of staff to which the staff member belongs:&lt;/p&gt;
