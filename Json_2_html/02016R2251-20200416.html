&lt;li&gt;the model captures the risk, otherwise not captured by other features of the model, arising from derivative contracts where the underlying asset class is credit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model captures the risk of movements between similar, but not identical, underlying risk factors and the exposure to changes in values arising from maturity mismatches;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;counterparties shall base the calculation on a liquidation period of at least 10 business days;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;counterparties shall take into account the lesser liquidity of low quality assets. They shall adjust the liquidation period upwards in cases where there are doubts concerning the liquidity of the collateral. They shall also identify where historical data may understate potential volatility. Such cases shall be dealt with by means of a stress scenario;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the length of the historical observation period institutions use for calculating haircuts shall be at least 1 year. For counterparties that use a weighting scheme or other methods for the historical observation period, the length of the effective observation period shall be at least 1 year;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI, counterparties may use their own volatility estimate for each category of security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In determining relevant categories of securities for the purposes of paragraph 3, counterparties shall take into account the type of issuer of the security, the external credit assessment of the securities, their residual maturity, and their modified duration. Volatility estimates shall be representative of the securities included in the category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The calculation of haircuts resulting from the application of point (c) of paragraph 1 shall meet all of the following conditions:&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a counterparty shall use the volatility estimates in the day-to-day risk management process including in relation to its exposure limits;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for the purposes of point (c), the net replacement cost of a netting set shall be the bigger between zero and the sum of current market values of all OTC derivative contracts in the netting set;&lt;/li&gt;
