&lt;li&gt;retainer means the entity acting as originator, sponsor or original lender which retains a net economic interest in the securitisation in accordance with Article 405(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetic form of retention means retention of economic interest through the use of derivative instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contingent form of retention means retention of economic interest through the use of guarantees, letters of credit and other similar forms of credit support ensuring an immediate enforcement of the retention;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical tranche means a tranche which exposes the holder of the tranche to the credit risk of each issued tranche of the securitisation transaction on a pro-rata basis.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where an institution acts as a credit derivative counterparty or as a counterparty providing the hedge or as a liquidity facility provider with regard to a securitisation transaction, it shall be deemed to become exposed to the credit risk of a securitisation position when the derivative, the hedge or the liquidity facility assumes the credit risk of the securitised exposures or the securitisation positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of Article 405 and 406 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, where a liquidity facility complies with the conditions specified in paragraph 2 of Article 255 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the liquidity provider shall not be deemed to become exposed to the credit risk of a securitisation position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the context of a re-securitisation with more than one level or a securitisation with multiple discrete underlying transactions, an institution shall be deemed to become exposed to the credit risk only of the individual securitisation position or transaction to which it is assuming exposure.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall not be deemed to be in breach of Article 405 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in accordance with Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on a consolidated basis provided that the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the entity which holds the securitisation positions is established in a third country and is included in the consolidated group in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 3, where the securitised exposures are created by multiple originators or multiple original lenders, the retention requirement may be fulfilled in full by a single originator or original lender provided that either of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where an entity other than a credit institution as defined in Article 4(1)(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 acts as a retainer through a synthetic or contingent form of retention, the interest retained on a synthetic or contingent basis shall be fully collateralised in cash and held on a segregated basis as clients funds as referred to in Article 13(8) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the CouncilDirective 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC (OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1)..&lt;/li&gt;

When preparing for the selection process, the retainer shall take appropriate quantitative and qualitative factors into account in order to ensure that the distinction between retained and securitised exposures is genuinely random. The retainer of randomly selected exposures shall take into consideration, where appropriate, factors such as vintage, product, geography, origination date, maturity date, loan to value ratio, property type, industry sector, and outstanding loan balance when selecting exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The retainer shall not designate different individual exposures as retained exposures at different points in time, unless this is necessary to fulfil the retention requirement in relation to a securitisation in which the securitised exposures fluctuate over time, either due to new exposures being added to the securitisation or to changes in the level of the individual securitised exposures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the fulfilment of the risk retention requirement at a securitisation scheme level institutions shall not take into account the existence of underlying transactions in which the originators or original lenders retain a first loss exposure at the transaction-specific level.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The retention referred to in paragraph 1 may be fulfilled by the sale at a discounted value of the underlying exposures by the originator or original lender, where the amount of the discount is not less than 5 % of the nominal value of each exposure and where the discounted sale amount is only refundable to the originator or original lender where it is not absorbed by losses related to the credit risk associated to the securitised exposures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, provided that there is no embedded mechanism by which the retained interest at origination would decline faster than the interest transferred, the fulfilment of the retention requirement shall not be deemed to have been affected by the amortisation of the retention via cash flow allocation or through the allocation of losses, which, in effect, reduce the level of retention over time.

&lt;li&gt;Where the exemptions referred to in paragraph 3 or 4 of Article 405 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 apply to a securitisation transaction, institutions acting as originator, sponsor or original lender shall disclose information on the applicable exemption to investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disclosure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be appropriately documented and made publicly available, except in bilateral or private transactions where private disclosure is considered by the parties to be sufficient. The inclusion of a statement on the retention commitment in the prospectus for the securities issued under the securitisation programme shall be considered an appropriate means of fulfilling the requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure shall also be confirmed after origination with the same regularity as the reporting frequency of the transaction, at least annually and in any of the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where a breach of the retention commitment referred to in Article 405(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 occurs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the performance of the securitisation position or the risk characteristics of the securitisation or of the underlying exposures materially change;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following a breach of the obligations included in the documentation relating to the securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Materially relevant data on the individual underlying exposures shall, in general, be provided on a loan-by-loan basis; however in certain instances the data provided on an aggregate basis may be sufficient. In assessing whether data provided on an aggregate basis is sufficient, factors to be taken into account shall include the granularity of the underlying pool and whether the management of the exposures in that pool is based on the pool itself or on a loan-by-loan basis.&lt;/li&gt;
