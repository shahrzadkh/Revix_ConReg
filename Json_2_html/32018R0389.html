&lt;li&gt;apply the procedure of strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exempt the application of the security requirements of strong customer authentication, subject to specified and limited conditions based on the level of risk, the amount and the recurrence of the payment transaction and of the payment channel used for its execution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service user&#x27;s personalised security credentials;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish common and secure open standards for the communication between account servicing payment service providers, payment initiation service providers, account information service providers, payers, payees and other payment service providers in relation to the provision and use of payment services in application of Title IV of Directive (EU) 2015/2366.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Payment service providers shall have transaction monitoring mechanisms in place that enable them to detect unauthorised or fraudulent payment transactions for the purpose of the implementation of the security measures referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 1.&lt;br&gt;Those mechanisms shall be based on the analysis of payment transactions taking into account elements which are typical of the payment service user in the circumstances of a normal use of the personalised security credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment service providers shall ensure that the transaction monitoring mechanisms take into account, at a minimum, each of the following risk-based factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lists of compromised or stolen authentication elements;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, the authentication shall be based on two or more elements which are categorised as knowledge, possession and inherence and shall result in the generation of an authentication code.&lt;br&gt;The authentication code shall be only accepted once by the payment service provider when the payer uses the authentication code to access its payment account online, to initiate an electronic payment transaction or to carry out any action through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of paragraph 1, payment service providers shall adopt security measures ensuring that each of the following requirements is met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no information on any of the elements referred to in paragraph 1 can be derived from the disclosure of the authentication code;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not possible to generate a new authentication code based on the knowledge of any other authentication code previously generated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the authentication code cannot be forged.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment service providers shall ensure that the authentication by means of generating an authentication code includes each of the following measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the authentication for remote access, remote electronic payments and any other actions through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses has failed to generate an authentication code for the purposes of paragraph 1, it shall not be possible to identify which of the elements referred to in that paragraph was incorrect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of failed authentication attempts that can take place consecutively, after which the actions referred to in Article 97(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 shall be temporarily or permanently blocked, shall not exceed five within a given period of time;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the communication sessions are protected against the capture of authentication data transmitted during the authentication and against manipulation by unauthorised parties in accordance with the requirements in Chapter V;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the maximum time without activity by the payer after being authenticated for accessing its payment account online shall not exceed 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the block referred to in paragraph 3(b) is temporary, the duration of that block and the number of retries shall be established based on the characteristics of the service provided to the payer and all the relevant risks involved, taking into account, at a minimum, the factors referred to in Article 2(2).&lt;br&gt;The payer shall be alerted before the block is made permanent.&lt;br&gt;Where the block has been made permanent, a secure procedure shall be established allowing the payer to regain use of the blocked electronic payment instruments.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the payer is made aware of the amount of the payment transaction and of the payee;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the authentication code generated is specific to the amount of the payment transaction and the payee agreed to by the payer when initiating the transaction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the authentication code accepted by the payment service provider corresponds to the original specific amount of the payment transaction and to the identity of the payee agreed to by the payer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any change to the amount or the payee results in the invalidation of the authentication code generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of paragraph 1, payment service providers shall adopt security measures which ensure the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of the transaction and the payee throughout all of the phases of the authentication;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the information displayed to the payer throughout all of the phases of the authentication including the generation, transmission and use of the authentication code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of paragraph 1(b) and where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 the following requirements for the authentication code shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in relation to a card-based payment transaction for which the payer has given consent to the exact amount of the funds to be blocked pursuant to Article 75(1) of that Directive, the authentication code shall be specific to the amount that the payer has given consent to be blocked and agreed to by the payer when initiating the transaction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in relation to payment transactions for which the payer has given consent to execute a batch of remote electronic payment transactions to one or several payees, the authentication code shall be specific to the total amount of the batch of payment transactions and to the specified payees.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Payment service providers shall adopt security measures, where any of the elements of strong customer authentication or the authentication code itself is used through a multi-purpose device, to mitigate the risk which would result from that multi-purpose device being compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of paragraph 2, the mitigating measures shall include each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the use of separated secure execution environments through the software installed inside the multi-purpose device;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of authentication of the payment service user, the interface referred to in paragraph 1 shall allow account information service providers and payment initiation service providers to rely on all the authentication procedures provided by the account servicing payment service provider to the payment service user.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interface shall at least meet all of the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Account servicing payment service providers shall ensure that their interfaces follow standards of communication which are issued by international or European standardisation organisations.&lt;br&gt;Account servicing payment service providers shall also ensure that the technical specification of any of the interfaces is documented specifying a set of routines, protocols, and tools needed by payment initiation service providers, account information service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments for allowing their software and applications to interoperate with the systems of the account servicing payment service providers.&lt;br&gt;Account servicing payment service providers shall at a minimum, and no less than 6 months before the application date referred to in Article 38(2), or before the target date for the market launch of the access interface when the launch takes place after the date referred to in Article 38(2), make the documentation available, at no charge, upon request by authorised payment initiation service providers, account information service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments or payment service providers that have applied to their competent authorities for the relevant authorisation, and shall make a summary of the documentation publicly available on their website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to paragraph 3, account servicing payment service providers shall ensure that, except for emergency situations, any change to the technical specification of their interface is made available to authorised payment initiation service providers, account information service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments, or payment service providers that have applied to their competent authorities for the relevant authorisation, in advance as soon as possible and not less than 3 months before the change is implemented.&lt;br&gt;Payment service providers shall document emergency situations where changes were implemented and make the documentation available to competent authorities on request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account servicing payment service providers shall make available a testing facility, including support, for connection and functional testing to enable authorised payment initiation service providers, payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments and account information service providers, or payment service providers that have applied for the relevant authorisation, to test their software and applications used for offering a payment service to users. This testing facility should be made available no later than 6 months before the application date referred to in Article 38(2) or before the target date for the market launch of the access interface when the launch takes place after the date referred to in Article 38(2).&lt;br&gt;However, no sensitive information shall be shared through the testing facility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall ensure that account servicing payment service providers comply at all times with the obligations included in these standards in relation to the interface(s) that they put in place. In the event that an account servicing payment services provider fails to comply with the requirements for interfaces laid down in these standards, competent authorities shall ensure that the provision of payment initiation services and account information services is not prevented or disrupted to the extent that the respective providers of such services comply with the conditions defined under Article 33(5).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Subject to compliance with Article 30 and 31, account servicing payment service providers that have put in place a dedicated interface shall ensure that the dedicated interface offers at all times the same level of availability and performance, including support, as the interfaces made available to the payment service user for directly accessing its payment account online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account servicing payment service providers that have put in place a dedicated interface shall define transparent key performance indicators and service level targets, at least as stringent as those set for the interface used by their payment service users both in terms of availability and of data provided in accordance with Article 36. Those interfaces, indicators and targets shall be monitored by the competent authorities and stress-tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account servicing payment service providers that have put in place a dedicated interface shall ensure that this interface does not create obstacles to the provision of payment initiation and account information services. Such obstacles, may include, among others, preventing the use by payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) of the credentials issued by account servicing payment service providers to their customers, imposing redirection to the account servicing payment service provider&#x27;s authentication or other functions, requiring additional authorisations and registrations in addition to those provided for in Articles 11, 14 and 15 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, or requiring additional checks of the consent given by payment service users to providers of payment initiation and account information services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2, account servicing payment service providers shall monitor the availability and performance of the dedicated interface. Account servicing payment service providers shall publish on their website quarterly statistics on the availability and performance of the dedicated interface and of the interface used by its payment service users.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Account servicing payment service providers shall include, in the design of the dedicated interface, a strategy and plans for contingency measures for the event that the interface does not perform in compliance with Article 32, that there is unplanned unavailability of the interface and that there is a systems breakdown. Unplanned unavailability or a systems breakdown may be presumed to have arisen when five consecutive requests for access to information for the provision of payment initiation services or account information services are not replied to within 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contingency measures shall include communication plans to inform payment service providers making use of the dedicated interface of measures to restore the system and a description of the immediately available alternative options payment service providers may have during this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the account servicing payment service provider and the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) shall report problems with dedicated interfaces as described in paragraph 1 to their respective competent national authorities without delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of a contingency mechanism, payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) shall be allowed to make use of the interfaces made available to the payment service users for the authentication and communication with their account servicing payment service provider, until the dedicated interface is restored to the level of availability and performance provided for in Article 32.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, account servicing payment service providers shall ensure that the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) can be identified and can rely on the authentication procedures provided by the account servicing payment service provider to the payment service user. Where the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) make use of the interface referred to in paragraph 4 they shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take the necessary measures to ensure that they do not access, store or process data for purposes other than for the provision of the service as requested by the payment service user;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue to comply with the obligations following from Article 66(3) and Article 67(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 respectively;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;log the data that are accessed through the interface operated by the account servicing payment service provider for its payment service users, and provide, upon request and without undue delay, the log files to their competent national authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;duly justify to their competent national authority, upon request and without undue delay, the use of the interface made available to the payment service users for directly accessing its payment account online;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inform the account servicing payment service provider accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competent authorities, after consulting EBA to ensure a consistent application of the following conditions, shall exempt the account servicing payment service providers that have opted for a dedicated interface from the obligation to set up the contingency mechanism described under paragraph 4 where the dedicated interface meets all of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it complies with all the obligations for dedicated interfaces as set out in Article 32;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has been designed and tested in accordance with Article 30(5) to the satisfaction of the payment service providers referred to therein;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has been widely used for at least 3 months by payment service providers to offer account information services, payment initiation services and to provide confirmation on the availability of funds for card-based payments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any problem related to the dedicated interface has been resolved without undue delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
