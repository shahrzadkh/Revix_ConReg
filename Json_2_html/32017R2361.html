&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total amount to be raised in accordance with Article 3 shall be allocated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;95 % to the following entities and groups:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;entities and groups with regard to which the Board has decided to exercise powers under Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 pursuant to Article 7(4)(b) of that Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entities and groups in relation to which participating Member States have decided in accordance with Article 7(5) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 that the Board exercise powers and responsibilities conferred to it by that Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 % to entities and groups referred to in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to Article 7, the Board shall assign entities and groups to one of the two categories laid down in paragraph 1 based on the data which the ECB provides to the Board in accordance with Article 6(1) or Article 11, as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an entity falls under the scope of paragraph 1(a), all the entities that are part of the same group shall be assigned to the same category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Board shall report yearly to the Commission on the appropriateness of the allocation laid down in paragraph 1, in the light of the changing composition of the two categories of entities and groups.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Board shall calculate the individual annual contributions due for each financial year on the basis of the data received in accordance with Article 6 and the total amount of annual contributions as determined in accordance with Article 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of calculating the individual annual contributions, the Board shall apply the provisions laid down in Article 10(1), (2) and (3) and Article 10(6)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;annual supervisory fee means individual annual contribution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significant supervised entity or significant supervised group means an entity or group as referred to in Article 4(1)(a);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The annual contribution due by the entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 that are members of the same group shall be calculated as a single contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the Board makes an error in the calculation of an individual annual contribution, it shall rectify the error by recalculating the individual annual contribution of each affected entity. The Board shall settle any difference between the individual annual contribution paid and the recalculated amount by increasing or decreasing the individual annual contribution calculated in the financial year following the recalculation.&lt;br&gt;However, no recalculation shall be performed where the Board becomes aware of an error more than 5 years after the end of the financial year in which the error occurred.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the identity and contact details of each contribution debtor as determined in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014 for the purpose of the supervisory fees;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fee factors determined in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether a contribution debtor is significant in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 or is an entity or group in relation to which the ECB has decided in accordance with Article 6(5)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 to exercise directly all of the relevant powers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any data that the ECB has determined in the absence of reporting from a contribution debtor, in accordance with Article 10(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where, for the purposes of this Regulation, the Board needs to identify whether an entity is part of the group that has nominated a given contribution debtor, the ECB, national resolution authorities and national competent authorities shall assist the Board with all relevant information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case the ECB issues additional invoices or recalculates the annual supervisory fee in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014, the ECB shall communicate to the Board the new data within 5 days of the issuance of fee notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the calculation of the individual annual contributions to be collected in a given financial year, the Board shall use the data collected by the ECB in the previous financial year in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014 and provided to the Board in accordance with this Article or Article 11, as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In case no data provided by the national competent authority is available, the contribution debtor shall upon request provide the Board with the necessary data within a deadline set by the Board.

&lt;li&gt;Where the status of an entity or a group changes between the categories specified in Article 4(1) during a financial year, its individual annual contribution for that financial year shall be calculated on the basis of the number of months for which the entity or a group fell under the respective category at the last day of the month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where other changes to the data of an entity or a group that were used to calculate its individual annual contribution for a financial year occur, the individual annual contribution of that entity or group for that financial year shall be calculated on the basis of the updated data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a change as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been reported by the ECB or a change as referred to in paragraph 3 occurred, the Board shall recalculate only the individual annual contribution of that entity or group for the financial years concerned. Where changes as referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 have occurred in relation to several entities or groups during the same financial year, the Board shall only take into account the changes concerning an individual entity or group for the purposes of recalculating the individual annual contribution of that entity or group.&lt;/li&gt;

Where the amount of an individual annual contribution paid is lower than the amount recalculated in accordance with paragraph 4, the entity or group concerned shall pay the difference to the Board. For the purposes of refunding or collecting an amount due in accordance with this paragraph, the Board shall decrease or increase the individual annual contribution of the entity or group concerned in the financial year following the recalculation pursuant to paragraph 4.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In line with the principle of sound management of its budget, the Board shall take any decisions deemed necessary in order to implement the provisions laid down in this Article, including as regards the timing of the refunds by the Board and of the additional payments to be collected from the entities.&lt;/li&gt;
