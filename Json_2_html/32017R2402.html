&lt;li&gt;This Regulation lays down a general framework for securitisation. It defines securitisation and establishes due-diligence, risk-retention and transparency requirements for parties involved in securitisations, criteria for credit granting, requirements for selling securitisations to retail clients, a ban on re-securitisation, requirements for SSPEs as well as conditions and procedures for securitisation repositories. It also creates a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Regulation applies to institutional investors and to originators, sponsors, original lenders and securitisation special purpose entities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;payments in the transaction or scheme are dependent upon the performance of the exposure or of the pool of exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the subordination of tranches determines the distribution of losses during the ongoing life of the transaction or scheme;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the transaction or scheme does not create exposures which possess all of the characteristics listed in Article 147(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tranche means a contractually established segment of the credit risk associated with an exposure or a pool of exposures, where a position in the segment entails a risk of credit loss greater than or less than a position of the same amount in another segment, without taking account of credit protection provided by third parties directly to the holders of positions in the segment or in other segments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asset-backed commercial paper programme or ABCP programme means a programme of securitisations the securities issued by which predominantly take the form of asset-backed commercial paper with an original maturity of one year or less;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;where the originator or original lender established in the Union is not a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in points (1) and (2) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1) of this Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the originator or original lender is established in a third country, the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes to ensure that credit-granting is based on a thorough assessment of the obligor’s creditworthiness;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if established in the Union, the originator, sponsor or original lender retains on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in accordance with Article 6 and the risk retention is disclosed to the institutional investor in accordance with Article 7;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if established in a third country, the originator, sponsor or original lender retains on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall not be less than 5 %, determined in accordance with Article 6, and discloses the risk retention to institutional investors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the originator, sponsor or SSPE has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that Article;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By derogation from paragraph 1, as regards fully supported ABCP transactions, the requirement specified in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall apply to the sponsor. In such cases, the sponsor shall verify that the originator or original lender which is not a credit institution or an investment firm grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in accordance with Article 9(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to holding a securitisation position, an institutional investor, other than the originator, sponsor or original lender, shall carry out a due-diligence assessment which enables it to assess the risks involved. That assessment shall consider at least all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the risk characteristics of the individual securitisation position and of the underlying exposures;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;with regard to a securitisation notified as STS in accordance with Article 27, the compliance of that securitisation with the requirements provided for in Articles 19 to 22 or in Articles 23 to 26, and Article 27. Institutional investors may rely to an appropriate extent on the STS notification pursuant to Article 27(1) and on the information disclosed by the originator, sponsor and SSPE on the compliance with the STS requirements, without solely or mechanistically relying on that notification or information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Notwithstanding points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, in the case of a fully supported ABCP programme, institutional investors in the commercial paper issued by that ABCP programme shall consider the features of the ABCP programme and the full liquidity support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An institutional investor, other than the originator, sponsor or original lender, holding a securitisation position, shall at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish appropriate written procedures that are proportionate to the risk profile of the securitisation position and, where relevant, to the institutional investor’s trading and non-trading book, in order to monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 and the performance of the securitisation position and of the underlying exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where relevant with respect to the securitisation and the underlying exposures, those written procedures shall include monitoring of the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, recovery rates, repurchases, loan modifications, payment holidays, collateral type and occupancy, and frequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and geographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with band widths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Where the underlying exposures are themselves securitisation positions, as permitted under Article 8, institutional investors shall also monitor the exposures underlying those positions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of a securitisation other than a fully supported ABCP programme, regularly perform stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying exposures or, in the absence of sufficient data on cash flows and collateral values, stress tests on loss assumptions, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the risk of the securitisation position;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of fully supported ABCP programme, regularly perform stress tests on the solvency and liquidity of the sponsor;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure internal reporting to its management body so that the management body is aware of the material risks arising from the securitisation position and so that those risks are adequately managed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to demonstrate to its competent authorities, upon request, that it has a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the securitisation position and its underlying exposures and that it has implemented written policies and procedures for the risk management of the securitisation position and for maintaining records of the verifications and due diligence in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 and of any other relevant information; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of exposures to a fully supported ABCP programme, be able to demonstrate to its competent authorities, upon request, that it has a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the credit quality of the sponsor and of the terms of the liquidity facility provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article, where an institutional investor has given another institutional investor authority to make investment management decisions that might expose it to a securitisation, the institutional investor may instruct that managing party to fulfil its obligations under this Article in respect of any exposure to a securitisation arising from those decisions. Member States shall ensure that, where an institutional investor is instructed under this paragraph to fulfil the obligations of another institutional investor and fails to do so, any sanction under Articles 32 and 33 may be imposed on the managing party and not on the institutional investor who is exposed to the securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitisation shall retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than 5 %. That interest shall be measured at the origination and shall be determined by the notional value for off-balance-sheet items. Where the originator, sponsor or original lender have not agreed between them who will retain the material net economic interest, the originator shall retain the material net economic interest. There shall be no multiple applications of the retention requirements for any given securitisation. The material net economic interest shall not be split amongst different types of retainers and not be subject to any credit-risk mitigation or hedging.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this Article, an entity shall not be considered to be an originator where the entity has been established or operates for the sole purpose of securitising exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originators shall not select assets to be transferred to the SSPE with the aim of rendering losses on the assets transferred to the SSPE, measured over the life of the transaction, or over a maximum of 4 years where the life of the transaction is longer than four years, higher than the losses over the same period on comparable assets held on the balance sheet of the originator. Where the competent authority finds evidence suggesting contravention of that prohibition, the competent authority shall investigate the performance of assets transferred to the SSPE and comparable assets held on the balance sheet of the originator. If the performance of the transferred assets is significantly lower than that of the comparable assets held on the balance sheet of the originator as a consequence of the intent of the originator, the competent authority shall impose a sanction pursuant to Articles 32 and 33.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the following shall qualify as a retention of a material net economic interest of not less than 5 % within the meaning of paragraph 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to not less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures, where such non-securitised exposures would otherwise have been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures is not less than 100 at origination;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the retention of the first loss tranche and, where such retention does not amount to 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures, if necessary, other tranches having the same or a more severe risk profile than those transferred or sold to investors and not maturing any earlier than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals in total not less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the retention of a first loss exposure of not less than 5 % of every securitised exposure in the securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purpose of paragraph 1, clawback provisions in national insolvency laws that allow the liquidator or a court to invalidate the sale of underlying exposures in the case of fraudulent transfers, unfair prejudice to creditors or transfers intended to improperly favour particular creditors over others shall not constitute severe clawback provisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the seller is not the original lender, the true sale or assignment or transfer with the same legal effect of the underlying exposures to that seller, whether that true sale or assignment or transfer with the same legal effect is direct or through one or more intermediate steps, shall meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The underlying exposures transferred from, or assigned by, the seller to the SSPE shall meet predetermined, clear and documented eligibility criteria which do not allow for active portfolio management of those exposures on a discretionary basis. For the purpose of this paragraph, substitution of exposures that are in breach of representations and warranties shall not be considered active portfolio management. Exposures transferred to the SSPE after the closing of the transaction shall meet the eligibility criteria applied to the initial underlying exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The securitisation shall be backed by a pool of underlying exposures that are homogeneous in terms of asset type, taking into account the specific characteristics relating to the cash flows of the asset type including their contractual, credit-risk and prepayment characteristics.

&lt;li&gt;The underlying exposures shall be originated in the ordinary course of the originator’s or original lender’s business pursuant to underwriting standards that are no less stringent than those that the originator or original lender applied at the time of origination to similar exposures that are not securitised. The underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying exposures are originated and any material changes from prior underwriting standards shall be fully disclosed to potential investors without undue delay.&lt;br&gt;In the case of securitisations where the underlying exposures are residential loans, the pool of loans shall not include any loan that was marketed and underwritten on the premise that the loan applicant or, where applicable, intermediaries were made aware that the information provided might not be verified by the lender.&lt;br&gt;The assessment of the borrower’s creditworthiness shall meet the requirements set out in Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC or paragraphs 1 to 4, point (a) of paragraph 5, and paragraph 6 of Article 18 of Directive 2014/17/EU or, where applicable, equivalent requirements in third countries.&lt;br&gt;The originator or original lender shall have expertise in originating exposures of a similar nature to those securitised.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a restructured underlying exposure has not presented new arrears since the date of the restructuring, which must have taken place at least one year prior to the date of transfer or assignment of the underlying exposures to the SSPE; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the information provided by the originator, sponsor and SSPE in accordance with points (a) and (e)(i) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(1) explicitly sets out the proportion of restructured underlying exposures, the time and details of the restructuring as well as their performance since the date of the restructuring;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The debtors shall, at the time of transfer of the exposures, have made at least one payment, except in the case of revolving securitisations backed by exposures payable in a single instalment or having a maturity of less than one year, including without limitation monthly payments on revolving credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The repayment of the holders of the securitisation positions shall not have been structured to depend predominantly on the sale of assets securing the underlying exposures. This shall not prevent such assets from being subsequently rolled-over or refinanced.&lt;br&gt;The repayment of the holders of the securitisation positions whose underlying exposures are secured by assets the value of which is guaranteed or fully mitigated by a repurchase obligation by the seller of the assets securing the underlying exposures or by another third party shall not be considered to depend on the sale of assets securing those underlying exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EBA, in close cooperation with ESMA and EIOPA, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards further specifying which underlying exposures referred to in paragraph 8 are deemed to be homogeneous.&lt;br&gt;The EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 July 2018.&lt;br&gt;The Commission is empowered to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

Except for the purpose of hedging interest-rate or currency risk, the SSPE shall not enter into derivative contracts and shall ensure that the pool of underlying exposures does not include derivatives. Those derivatives shall be underwritten and documented according to common standards in international finance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any referenced interest payments under the securitisation assets and liabilities shall be based on generally used market interest rates, or generally used sectoral rates reflective of the cost of funds, and shall not reference complex formulae or derivatives.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Transactions which feature non-sequential priority of payments shall include triggers relating to the performance of the underlying exposures resulting in the priority of payments reverting to sequential payments in order of seniority. Such performance-related triggers shall include at least the deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures below a predetermined threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The servicer shall have expertise in servicing exposures of a similar nature to those securitised and shall have well-documented and adequate policies, procedures and risk-management controls relating to the servicing of exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transaction documentation shall set out in clear and consistent terms definitions, remedies and actions relating to delinquency and default of debtors, debt restructuring, debt forgiveness, forbearance, payment holidays, losses, charge offs, recoveries and other asset performance remedies.

The sponsor shall disclose a description of the support provided at transaction level to the investors including a description of the liquidity facilities provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before being able to sponsor an STS ABCP programme, the credit institution shall demonstrate to its competent authority that its role under paragraph 2 does not endanger its solvency and liquidity, even in an extreme stress situation in the market.&lt;br&gt;The requirement referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be considered to be fulfilled where the competent authority has determined on the basis of the review and evaluation referred to Article 97(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU that the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by that credit institution and the own funds and liquidity held by it ensure the sound management and coverage of its risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sponsor shall perform its own due diligence and shall verify compliance with the requirements set out in Article 5(1) and (3) of this Regulation, as applicable. It shall also verify that the seller has in place servicing capabilities and collection processes that meet the requirements specified in points (h) to (p) of Article 265(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or equivalent requirements in third countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seller, at the level of a transaction, or the sponsor, at the level of the ABCP programme, shall satisfy the risk-retention requirement referred to in Article 6.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The securities issued by an ABCP programme shall not include call options, extension clauses or other clauses that have an effect on their final maturity, where such options or clauses may be exercised at the discretion of the seller, sponsor or SSPE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interest-rate and currency risks arising at ABCP programme level shall be appropriately mitigated and any measures taken to that effect shall be disclosed. Except for the purpose of hedging interest-rate or currency risk, the SSPE shall not enter into derivative contracts and shall ensure that the pool of underlying exposures does not include derivatives.

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the third party only charges non-discriminatory and cost-based fees to the originators, sponsors or SSPEs involved in the securitisations which the third party assesses without differentiating fees depending on, or correlated to, the results of its assessment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the third party is neither a regulated entity as defined in point (4) of Article 2 of Directive 2002/87/EC nor a credit rating agency as defined in point (b) of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, and the performance of the third party’s other activities does not compromise the independence or integrity of its assessment;&lt;/li&gt;

To that end, the third party shall establish, maintain, enforce and document an effective internal control system governing the implementation of policies and procedures to identify and prevent potential conflicts of interest. Potential or existing conflicts of interest which have been identified shall be eliminated or mitigated and disclosed without delay. The third party shall establish, maintain, enforce and document adequate procedures and processes to ensure the independence of the assessment of STS compliance.

&lt;li&gt;For the purpose of this Article, in the case of securitisations which do not involve the issuance of securities, any references to securitisations the securities of which were issued shall be deemed to mean securitisations the initial securitisation positions of which are created, provided that this Regulation applies to any securitisations that create new securitisation positions on or after 1 January 2019.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1 January 2021 and every three years thereafter, the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities shall publish a report on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the implementation of the STS requirements as provided for in Articles 18 to 27;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an assessment of the actions that competent authorities have undertaken, on material risks and new vulnerabilities that may have materialised and on the actions of market participants to further standardise securitisation documentation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the functioning of the due-diligence requirements provided for in Article 5 and the transparency requirements provided for in Article 7 and the level of transparency of the securitisation market in the Union, including on whether the transparency requirements provided for in Article 7 allow the competent authorities to have a sufficient overview of the market to fulfil their respective mandates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the requirements provided for in Article 6, including compliance therewith by market participants and the modalities for retaining risk pursuant to Article 6(3).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;By 2 July 2019, the EBA, in close cooperation with ESMA and EIOPA, shall publish a report on the feasibility of a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised synthetic securitisation, limited to balance-sheet synthetic securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 2 January 2020, the Commission shall, on the basis of the EBA report referred to in paragraph 1, submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the creation of a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised synthetic securitisation, limited to balance-sheet synthetic securitisation, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Synthetic securitisations</td><td>Article 45</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;div class=&quot;crrArticle&quot;&gt;By 1 January 2022, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of this Regulation, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That report shall consider in particular the findings of the reports referred to in Article 44, and shall assess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the effects of this Regulation, including the introduction of the STS securitisation designation, on the functioning of the market for securitisations in the Union, the contribution of securitisation to the real economy, in particular on access to credit for SMEs and investments, and interconnectedness between financial institutions and the stability of the financial sector;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the differences in use of the modalities referred to in Article 6(3), based on the data reported pursuant to point (e)(iii) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(1). If the findings show an increase in prudential risks caused by the use of the modalities referred to in points (a), (b), (c) and (e) of Article 6(3), then suitable redress shall be considered;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there has been a disproportionate rise of the number of transactions referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 7(2), since the application of this Regulation and whether market participants structured transactions in a way to circumvent the obligation under Article 7 to make available information through securitisation repositories;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there is a need to extend disclosure requirements under Article 7 to cover transactions referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 7(2) and investor positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether in the area of STS securitisations an equivalence regime could be introduced for third-country originators, sponsors and SSPEs, taking into consideration international developments in the area of securitisation, in particular initiatives on simple, transparent and comparable securitisations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the implementation of the requirements provided for in Article 22(4) and whether they need to be extended to securitisation where the underlying exposures are not residential loans or auto loans or leases, with the view to mainstreaming environmental, social and governance disclosure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the appropriateness of the third-party verification regime as provided for in Articles 27 and 28, and whether the authorisation regime for third parties provided for in Article 28 fosters sufficient competition among third parties and whether changes in the supervisory framework need to be introduced in order to ensure financial stability; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there is a need to complement the framework on securitisation set out in this Regulation by establishing a system of limited licensed banks, performing the functions of SSPEs and having the exclusive right to purchase exposures from originators and sell claims backed by the purchased exposures to investors.&lt;/li&gt;
