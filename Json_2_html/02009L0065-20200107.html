&lt;li&gt;the management company has an initial capital of at least EUR 125000, taking into account the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the value of the portfolios of the management company exceeds EUR 250000000, the management company must be required to provide an additional amount of own funds which is equal to 0,02 % of the amount by which the value of the portfolios of the management company exceeds EUR 250000000 but the required total of the initial capital and the additional amount must not, however, exceed EUR 10000000;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When establishing and applying the remuneration policies referred to in Article 14a, management companies shall comply with the following principles in a way and to the extent that is appropriate to their size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remuneration policy is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management and does not encourage risk taking which is inconsistent with the risk profiles, rules or instruments of incorporation of the UCITS that the management company manages;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remuneration policy is in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and interests of the management company and the UCITS that it manages and of the investors in such UCITS, and includes measures to avoid conflicts of interest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remuneration policy is adopted by the management body of the management company in its supervisory function, and that body adopts, and reviews at least annually, the general principles of the remuneration policy and is responsible for, and oversees, their implementation; the tasks referred to in this point shall be undertaken only by members of the management body who do not perform any executive functions in the management company concerned and who have expertise in risk management and remuneration;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the implementation of the remuneration policy is, at least annually, subject to central and independent internal review for compliance with policies and procedures for remuneration adopted by the management body in its supervisory function;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staff engaged in control functions are compensated in accordance with the achievement of the objectives linked to their functions, independently of the performance of the business areas that they control;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remuneration of the senior officers in the risk management and compliance functions is overseen directly by the remuneration committee, where such a committee exists;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where remuneration is performance-related, the total amount of remuneration is based on a combination of the assessment as to the performance of the individual and of the business unit or UCITS concerned and as to their risks and of the overall results of the management company when assessing individual performance, taking into account financial and non-financial criteria;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the assessment of performance is set in a multi-year framework appropriate to the holding period recommended to the investors of the UCITS managed by the management company in order to ensure that the assessment process is based on the longer-term performance of the UCITS and its investment risks and that the actual payment of performance-based components of remuneration is spread over the same period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;guaranteed variable remuneration is exceptional, occurs only in the context of hiring new staff and is limited to the first year of engagement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed and variable components of total remuneration are appropriately balanced and the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion of the total remuneration to allow the operation of a fully flexible policy on variable remuneration components, including the possibility to pay no variable remuneration component;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payments relating to the early termination of a contract reflect performance achieved over time and are designed in a way that does not reward failure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the measurement of performance used to calculate variable remuneration components or pools of variable remuneration components includes a comprehensive adjustment mechanism to integrate all relevant types of current and future risks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subject to the legal structure of the UCITS and its fund rules or instruments of incorporation, a substantial portion, and in any event at least 50 %, of any variable remuneration component consists of units of the UCITS concerned, equivalent ownership interests, or share-linked instruments or equivalent non-cash instruments with equally effective incentives as any of the instruments referred to in this point, unless the management of UCITS accounts for less than 50 % of the total portfolio managed by the management company, in which case the minimum of 50 % does not apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruments referred to in this point shall be subject to an appropriate retention policy designed to align incentives with the interests of the management company and the UCITS that it manages and the investors of such UCITS. Member States or their competent authorities may place restrictions on the types and designs of those instruments or ban certain instruments as appropriate. This point shall apply to both the portion of the variable remuneration component deferred in line with point (n) and the portion of the variable remuneration component not deferred;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a substantial portion, and in any event at least 40 %, of the variable remuneration component, is deferred over a period which is appropriate in view of the holding period recommended to the investors of the UCITS concerned and is correctly aligned with the nature of the risks of the UCITS in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period referred to in this point shall be at least three years; remuneration payable under deferral arrangements vests no faster than on a pro-rata basis; in the case of a variable remuneration component of a particularly high amount, at least 60 % of the amount shall be deferred;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the variable remuneration, including the deferred portion, is paid or vests only if it is sustainable according to the financial situation of the management company as a whole, and justified according to the performance of the business unit, the UCITS and the individual concerned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total variable remuneration shall generally be considerably contracted where subdued or negative financial performance of the management company or of the UCITS concerned occurs, taking into account both current compensation and reductions in payouts of amounts previously earned, including through malus or clawback arrangements;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pension policy is in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and long-term interests of the management company and the UCITS that it manages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the employee leaves the management company before retirement, discretionary pension benefits shall be held by the management company for a period of five years in the form of instruments referred to in point (m). In the case of an employee reaching retirement, discretionary pension benefits shall be paid to the employee in the form of instruments referred to in point (m), subject to a five-year retention period;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staff are required to undertake not to use personal hedging strategies or remuneration- and liability-related insurance to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in their remuneration arrangements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable remuneration is not paid through vehicles or methods that facilitate the avoidance of the requirements laid down in this Directive.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The principles set out in paragraph 1 shall apply to any benefit of any type paid by the management company, to any amount paid directly by the UCITS itself, including performance fees, and to any transfer of units or shares of the UCITS, made for the benefit of those categories of staff, including senior management, risk takers, control functions and any employee receiving total remuneration that falls into the remuneration bracket of senior management and risk takers, whose professional activities have a material impact on their risk profile or the risk profile of the UCITS that they manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management companies that are significant in terms of their size or of the size of the UCITS that they manage, their internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities shall establish a remuneration committee. The remuneration committee shall be constituted in a way that enables it to exercise competent and independent judgment on remuneration policies and practices and the incentives created for managing risk.&lt;br&gt;The remuneration committee that is, where appropriate, set up in accordance with the ESMA guidelines referred to in Article 14a(4) shall be responsible for the preparation of decisions regarding remuneration, including those which have implications for the risk and risk management of the management company or the UCITS concerned and which are to be taken by the management body in its supervisory function. The remuneration committee shall be chaired by a member of the management body who does not perform any executive functions in the management company concerned. The members of the remuneration committee shall be members of the management body who do not perform any executive functions in the management company concerned.&lt;br&gt;If employee representation on the management body is provided for by national law, the remuneration committee shall include one or more employee representatives.

&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities of the Member States shall cooperate with each other whenever necessary for the purpose of carrying out their duties under this Directive or of exercising their powers under this Directive or under national law.Member States shall take the necessary administrative and organisational measures to facilitate the cooperation provided for in this paragraph.Competent authorities shall use their powers for the purpose of cooperation, even in cases where the conduct under investigation does not constitute an infringement of any regulation in force in their Member State.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities of the Member States shall immediately provide each other with the information required for the purposes of carrying out their duties under this Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities shall cooperate with ESMA for the purposes of this Directive, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.The competent authorities shall without delay provide ESMA with all information necessary to carry out its duties, in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a competent authority of one Member State has good reason to suspect that acts contrary to the provisions of this Directive, are being or have been carried out by entities not subject to that competent authority’s supervision on the territory of another Member State, it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member State thereof in as specific a manner as possible. The recipient authorities shall take appropriate action, shall inform the notifying competent authority of the outcome of that action and, to the extent possible, of significant interim developments. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the competences of the notifying competent authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competent authorities of one Member State may request the cooperation of the competent authorities of another Member State in a supervisory activity or for an on-the-spot verification or in an investigation on the territory of the latter within the framework of their powers pursuant to this Directive. Where a competent authority receives a request with respect to an on-the-spot verification or investigation, it shall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If the verification or investigation is carried out on the territory of one Member State by a competent authority of the same Member State, the competent authority of the Member State which has requested cooperation may request that its own officials accompany the officials carrying out the verification or investigation. The verification or investigation shall, however, be subject to the overall control of the Member State on whose territory it is conducted.If the verification or investigation is carried out on the territory of one Member State by a competent authority of another Member State, the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory the verification or investigation is carried out may request that its own officials accompany the officials carrying out the verification or investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competent authorities of the Member State where the verification or investigation is carried out may refuse to exchange information as provided for in paragraph 2 or to act on a request for cooperation in carrying out an investigation or on-the-spot verification as provided for in paragraph 4, only where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such an investigation, on-the-spot verification or exchange of information might adversely affect the sovereignty, security or public policy of that Member State;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competent authorities may refer to ESMA situations where a request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to exchange information as provided for in Article 109 has been rejected or has not been acted upon within a reasonable time;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for authorisation for its officials to accompany those of the competent authority of the other Member State has been rejected or has not been acted upon within a reasonable time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without prejudice to Article 258 of the Treaty of on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), ESMA may, in situations referred to in the first subparagraph, act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, without prejudice to the possibilities for refusing to act on a request for information or for an investigation provided for in paragraph 6 of this Article and to the ability of ESMA to act in accordance with Article 17 of that Regulation in those cases.&lt;/p&gt;
