&lt;li&gt;The Board shall, on its own initiative after consulting the national resolution authority, or upon proposal by a national resolution authority, defer, in whole or in part, an institution&#x27;s payment of extraordinary ex post contributions in accordance with Article 71(2) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, if it is necessary to protect its financial position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deferral of extraordinary ex post contributions may be granted by the Board upon an institution&#x27;s request. That institution shall provide any information deemed necessary by the Board to conduct the assessment of the impact of the payment of extraordinary ex post contributions on its financial position. The Board shall take into account all information available to the national competent authorities to establish whether that institution meets the conditions for deferral referred to in paragraph 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When determining whether that institution meets the conditions for deferral, the Board shall assess the impact a payment of extraordinary ex post contributions would have on the solvency and liquidity position of that institution. Where that institution is part of a group, the assessment shall also include the impact of solvency and liquidity of the group as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board may defer payment of extraordinary ex post contributions where it concludes that the payment results in any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a likely breach, within the following six months, of the institution&#x27;s minimum own funds requirements set out in Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilRegulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1).;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a likely breach, within the following six months, of the institution&#x27;s minimum liquidity coverage requirement set out in Article 412(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and specified in Article 4 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 of 10 October 2014 to supplement Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council with regard to liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions (OJ L 11, 17.1.2015, p. 1).;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a likely breach, within the following six months, of the institution&#x27;s specific liquidity requirement set out in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the CouncilDirective 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Board shall limit the deferral period to the extent it is necessary to avoid risks to the financial position of that institution or its group. The Board shall regularly monitor whether the conditions for the deferral referred to in paragraph 4 continue to apply during the deferral period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon request of that institution, the Board may renew the deferral period, where it determines that the conditions for the deferral referred to in paragraph 4 continue to apply. This renewal shall not exceed 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Board, or the national resolution authority, shall assess the impact of the payment of extraordinary ex post contributions on the institution&#x27;s regulatory capital position.

&lt;li&gt;For the purpose of this assessment, the amount of ex post contributions shall be deducted from the institution&#x27;s own funds position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The analysis referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover at least the period up to the next reporting remittance date for the own funds requirement set out in Article 3 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions according to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 191, 28.6.2014, p. 1)..&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of the analysis described in paragraph 1, the Board shall add a liquidity outflow, equal to 100 % of the amount payable at the point in time when the payment of extraordinary ex post contributions is due, to the calculation of net liquidity outflows as set out in Article 20(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61.&lt;/li&gt;
