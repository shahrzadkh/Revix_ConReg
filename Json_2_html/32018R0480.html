&lt;li&gt;The circumstances in which the use of financial derivative instruments shall be considered as solely serving the purpose of hedging the risks inherent to other investments of the European long-term investment fund (ELTIF) as referred to in Article 9(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) 2015/760 are fulfilled when they meet all of the criteria set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A financial derivative instrument shall only be used for hedging risks arising from exposures to assets referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/760.&lt;br&gt;The purpose of hedging the risks arising from exposures to assets referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be considered to be fulfilled where the use of that financial derivative instrument results in a verifiable and objectively measurable reduction of those risks at the ELTIF level.&lt;br&gt;Where financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks arising from the exposure to the assets referred to in the first subparagraph are not available, financial derivative instruments with an underlying of the same asset class may be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of the financial derivative instruments aimed to provide a return for the ELTIF shall not be deemed to serve the purpose of hedging the risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The manager of the ELTIF shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the financial derivative instruments used to hedge the risks inherent to other investments of the ELTIF reduce the risks at the ELTIF level in accordance with paragraph 2, including in stressed market conditions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) 2015/760, the life of an ELTIF shall be considered sufficient in length to cover the life-cycle of each of the individual assets of the ELTIF where the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ELTIF aligns the date for the end of its life to the date of the end of the investment horizon of the individual asset within the ELTIF portfolio which has the longest investment horizon at the time of the submission of the application for authorisation as an ELTIF to the competent authority of the ELTIF;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any investment made by the ELTIF after the date of its authorisation as an ELTIF does not have a residual investment horizon exceeding the remaining life of the ELTIF at the time that investment is made.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether one or more potential buyers are present in the market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the manager of the ELTIF, based on an assessment conducted with due skill, care and diligence at the time of the completion of the schedule, expects the potential buyers to be dependent on external financing for buying the relevant asset;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where there are no potential buyers for an asset, the length of time likely to be necessary to find one or more buyers for that asset;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the specific maturity profile of the asset;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the manager of the ELTIF, based on an assessment conducted with due skill, care and diligence at the time of the completion of the schedule, expects the following risks to materialise:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a risk associated with legislative changes that could affect the market for potential buyers;&lt;/li&gt;
