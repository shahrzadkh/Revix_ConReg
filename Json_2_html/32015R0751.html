&lt;li&gt;This Regulation lays down uniform technical and business requirements for card-based payment transactions carried out within the Union, where both the payer&#x27;s payment service provider and the payee&#x27;s payment service provider are located therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Regulation does not apply to services based on specific payment instruments that can be used only in a limited way, that meet one of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instruments allowing the holder to acquire goods or services only in the premises of the issuer or within a limited network of service providers under direct commercial agreement with a professional issuer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instruments which can be used only to acquire a very limited range of goods or services;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instruments valid only in a single Member State provided at the request of an undertaking or a public sector entity and regulated by a national or regional public authority for specific social or tax purposes to acquire specific goods or services from suppliers having a commercial agreement with the issuer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter II does not apply to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transactions with commercial cards;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cash withdrawals at automatic teller machines or at the counter of a payment service provider; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transactions with payment cards issued by three party payment card schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 7 does not apply to three party payment card schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a three party payment card scheme licenses other payment service providers for the issuance of card-based payment instruments or the acquiring of card-based payment transactions, or both, or issues card-based payment instruments with a co-branding partner or through an agent, it is considered to be a four party payment card scheme. However, until 9 December 2018 in relation to domestic payment transactions, such a three party payment card scheme may be exempted from the obligations under Chapter II, provided that the card-based payment transactions made in a Member State under such a three party payment card scheme do not exceed on a yearly basis 3 % of the value of all card-based payment transactions made in that Member State.&lt;/li&gt;
