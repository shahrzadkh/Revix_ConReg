&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trade repository shall be deemed to offer ancillary services in any of the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where it directly provides ancillary services;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where an entity belonging to the same group as the trade repository provides ancillary services;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where an entity with which the trade repository has concluded an agreement in the context of the trading or post-trading chain or business line to cooperate in the provision of services provides the ancillary services.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where a trade repository does not provide ancillary services as referred to in paragraph 2, the trade repository concerned is deemed to have a low expected total turnover and shall pay a registration fee of EUR 65000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a trade repository provides ancillary services as referred to in paragraph 2, the trade repository is deemed to have a high expected total turnover and shall pay a registration fee of EUR 100000.&lt;/li&gt;
