&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions, investment firms, insurance undertakings, reinsurance undertakings, institutions for occupational retirement provision, management companies, investment companies, alternative investment fund managers and central counterparties may use credit ratings for regulatory purposes only if they are issued by credit rating agencies established in the Union and registered in accordance with this Regulation.&lt;br&gt;Where a prospectus contains a reference to a credit rating or credit ratings, the issuer, offeror, or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market shall ensure that the prospectus also includes clear and prominent information stating whether or not such credit ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the Union and registered under this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credit rating agency established in the Union and registered in accordance with this Regulation shall be deemed to have issued a credit rating when the credit rating has been published on the credit rating agency’s website or by other means or distributed by subscription and presented and disclosed in accordance with the obligations of Article 10, clearly identifying that the credit rating is endorsed in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency established in the Union and registered in accordance with this Regulation may endorse a credit rating issued in a third country only when credit rating activities resulting in the issuing of such a credit rating comply with the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit rating activities resulting in the issuing of the credit rating to be endorsed are undertaken in whole or in part by the endorsing credit rating agency or by credit rating agencies belonging to the same group;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit rating agency has verified and is able to demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilOJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84., that the conduct of the credit rating activities by the third-country credit rating agency resulting in the issuing of the credit rating to be endorsed fulfils requirements which are at least as stringent as the requirements set out in Articles 6 to 12 and Annex I, with the exception of Articles 6a, 6b, 8a, 8b, 8c and 11a, point (ba) of point 3 and points 3a and 3b of Section B of Annex I.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ability of ESMA to assess and monitor the compliance of the credit rating agency established in the third country with the requirements referred to in point (b) is not limited;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit rating agency makes available on request to ESMA all the information necessary to enable ESMA to supervise on an ongoing basis the compliance with the requirements of this Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is an objective reason for the credit rating to be elaborated in a third country;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit rating agency established in the third country is authorised or registered, and is subject to supervision, in that third country;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the regulatory regime in that third country prevents interference by the competent authorities and other public authorities of that third country with the content of credit ratings and methodologies; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is an appropriate cooperation arrangement between ESMA and the relevant supervisory authority of the credit rating agency established in a third country. ESMA shall ensure that such a cooperation arrangement shall specify at least:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mechanism for the exchange of information between ESMA and the relevant supervisory authority of the credit rating agency established in a third country; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the procedures concerning the coordination of supervisory activities in order to enable ESMA to monitor credit rating activities resulting in the issuing of the endorsed credit rating on an ongoing basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credit rating endorsed in accordance with paragraph 3 shall be considered to be a credit rating issued by a credit rating agency established in the Union and registered in accordance with this Regulation.A credit rating agency established in the Union and registered in accordance with this Regulation shall not use such endorsement with the intention of avoiding the requirements of this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit rating agency that has endorsed a credit rating issued in a third country in accordance with paragraph 3 shall remain fully responsible for such a credit rating and for the fulfilment of conditions set out therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the Commission has recognised, in accordance with Article 5(6), the legal and supervisory framework of a third country as equivalent to the requirements of this Regulation and the cooperation arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) are operational, the credit rating agency endorsing credit ratings issued in that third country shall no longer be required to verify or demonstrate that the condition laid down in paragraph 3(g) of this Article is fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit ratings that are related to entities established or financial instruments issued in third countries and that are issued by a credit rating agency established in a third country may be used in the Union under Article 4(1) without being endorsed in accordance with Article 4(3), provided that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit rating agency is authorised or registered in and is subject to supervision in that third country;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Commission has adopted an equivalence decision in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article, recognising the legal and supervisory framework of that third country as equivalent to the requirements of this Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cooperation arrangements referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article are operational;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit ratings issued by the credit rating agency and its credit rating activities are not of systemic importance to the financial stability or integrity of the financial markets of one or more Member States; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit rating agency is certified in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit rating agency referred to in paragraph 1 may apply for certification. The application shall be submitted to ESMA in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ESMA shall examine and decide on the application for certification in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16. The certification decision shall be based on the criteria set out in points (a) to (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article.The certification decision shall be notified and published in accordance with Article 18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit rating agency referred to in paragraph 1 may also apply to be exempted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on a case-by-case basis from complying with some or all of the requirements set out in Section A of Annex I and Article 7(4) if the credit rating agency is able to demonstrate that the requirements are not proportionate in view of the nature, scale and complexity of its business and the nature and range of its issuing of credit ratings;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from the requirement of physical presence in the Union where such a requirement would be too burdensome and disproportionate in view of the nature, scale and complexity of its business and the nature and range of its issuing of credit ratings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;An application for an exemption under point (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph shall be submitted by the credit rating agency together with the application for certification. When assessing such an application, ESMA shall take into consideration the size of the credit rating agency referred to in paragraph 1, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of its business and the nature and range of its issuing of credit ratings, as well as the impact of the credit ratings issued by the credit rating agency on the financial stability and integrity of the financial markets of one or more Member States. On the basis of those considerations, ESMA may grant such exemption to the credit rating agency referred to in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The decisions on the exemptions under paragraph 4 of this Article shall be subject to the relevant provisions and procedures set out in Article 16 with the exception of the second subparagraph of paragraph 7 of that Article. In the event of continued absence of agreement among the members of the relevant college on whether to grant an exemption to the credit rating agency, the facilitator shall adopt a fully reasoned decision.For the purposes of certification, including the granting of exemptions, and supervision, the facilitator shall perform the tasks of the competent authority of the home Member State where relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission may adopt an equivalence decision in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 38(3), stating that the legal and supervisory framework of a third country ensures that credit rating agencies authorised or registered in that third country comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements resulting from this Regulation and which are subject to effective supervision and enforcement in that third country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third-country legal and supervisory framework may be considered equivalent to this Regulation if that framework fulfils at least the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies in that third country are subject to authorisation or registration and are subject to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies in that third country are subject to legally binding rules which are equivalent to those set out in Articles 6 to 12 and Annex I, with the exception of Articles 6a, 6b, 8a, 8b, 8c and 11a, point (ba) of point 3 and points 3a and 3b of Section B of Annex I; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the regulatory regime in that third country prevents interference by the supervisory authorities and other public authorities of that third country with the content of credit ratings and methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take account of developments on financial markets, the Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 38a, and subject to the conditions of Articles 38b and 38c, measures to specify further or amend the criteria set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of the second subparagraph of this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESMA shall establish cooperation agreements with the relevant supervisory authorities of third countries whose legal and supervisory frameworks have been considered equivalent to this Regulation in accordance with paragraph 6. Such arrangements shall specify at least:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;whether there is a need to implement other measures to foster competition in the credit rating market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the appropriateness of additional initiatives to promote competition in the credit rating market against the background of the evolution of the structure of the sector;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there is a need to propose measures to address contractual over-reliance on credit ratings;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the credit rating agency complies with the remaining requirements of this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall be organised in a way that ensures that its business interest does not impair the independence or accuracy of the credit rating activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior management of a credit rating agency shall be of good repute and sufficiently skilled and experienced, and shall ensure the sound and prudent management of the credit rating agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one third, but no less than two, of the members of the administrative or supervisory board of a credit rating agency shall be independent members who are not involved in credit rating activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensation of the independent members of the administrative or supervisory board shall not be linked to the business performance of the credit rating agency and shall be arranged so as to ensure the independence of their judgement.

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall ensure that fees charged to its clients for the provision of credit rating and ancillary services are not discriminatory and are based on actual costs. Fees charged for credit rating services shall not depend on the level of the credit rating issued by the credit rating agency or on any other result or outcome of the work performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies shall ensure that the lead rating analysts shall not be involved in credit rating activities related to the same rated entity or a related third party for a period exceeding four years;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;title-gr-seq-level-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;italics&quot;&gt;Section D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall ensure that any credit rating and rating outlook states clearly and prominently the name and job title of the lead rating analyst in a given credit rating activity and the name and position of the person primarily responsible for approving the credit rating or rating outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall ensure that at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all substantially material sources, including the rated entity or, where appropriate, a related third party, which were used to prepare the credit rating or rating outlook are indicated together with an indication as to whether the credit rating or rating outlook has been disclosed to that rated entity or related third party and amended following that disclosure before being issued;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal methodology or version of methodology that was used in determining the rating is clearly indicated, with a reference to its comprehensive description; where the credit rating is based on more than one methodology, or where reference only to the principal methodology might cause investors to overlook other important aspects of the credit rating, including any significant adjustments and deviations, the credit rating agency shall explain this fact in the credit rating and indicate how the different methodologies or these other aspects are taken into account in the credit rating;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the meaning of each rating category, the definition of default or recovery and any appropriate risk warning, including a sensitivity analysis of the relevant key rating assumptions, such as mathematical or correlation assumptions, accompanied by worst-case scenario credit ratings as well as best-case scenario credit ratings are explained;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;in the case of a rating outlook, the time horizon is provided during which a change in the credit rating is expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When publishing credit ratings or rating outlooks, credit rating agencies shall include a reference to the historical default rates published by ESMA in a central repository in accordance with Article 11(2), together with an explanatory statement of the meaning of those default rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall accompany the disclosure of rating methodologies, models and key rating assumptions with guidance which explains assumptions, parameters, limits and uncertainties surrounding the models and rating methodologies used in credit ratings, including simulations of stress scenarios undertaken by the credit rating agency when establishing the credit ratings, credit rating information on cash-flow analysis it has performed or is relying upon and, where applicable, an indication of any expected change in the credit rating. Such guidance shall be clear and easily comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit rating agency shall inform the rated entity during working hours of the rated entity and at least a full working day before publication of the credit rating or the rating outlook. That information shall include the principal grounds on which the credit rating or rating outlook is based in order to give the rated entity an opportunity to draw attention of the credit rating agency to any factual errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall state clearly and prominently when disclosing credit ratings or rating outlooks any attributes and limitations of the credit rating or rating outlook. In particular, a credit rating agency shall prominently state when disclosing any credit rating or rating outlook whether it considers satisfactory the quality of information available on the rated entity and to what extent it has verified information provided to it by the rated entity or a related third party. If a credit rating or a rating outlook involves a type of entity or financial instrument for which historical data is limited, the credit rating agency shall make clear, in a prominent place, such limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case where the lack of reliable data or the complexity of the structure of a new type of financial instrument or the quality of information available is not satisfactory or raises serious questions as to whether a credit rating agency can provide a credible credit rating, the credit rating agency shall refrain from issuing a credit rating or withdraw an existing rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When announcing a credit rating or a rating outlook, a credit rating agency shall explain in its press releases or reports the key elements underlying the credit rating or the rating outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the information laid down in points 1, 2 and 4 would be disproportionate in relation to the length of the report distributed, it shall suffice to make clear and prominent reference in the report itself to the place where such disclosures can be directly and easily accessed, including a direct web link to the disclosure on an appropriate website of the credit rating agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall disclose on its website, and notify ESMA on an ongoing basis, information about all entities or debt instruments submitted to it for their initial review or for preliminary rating. Such disclosure shall be made whether or not issuers contract with the credit rating agency for a final rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a credit rating agency rates a securitisation instrument, it shall provide in the credit rating all information about loss and cash-flow analysis it has performed or is relying upon and an indication of any expected change in the credit rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall state what level of assessment it has performed concerning the due diligence processes carried out at the level of underlying financial instruments or other assets of securitisation instruments. The credit rating agency shall disclose whether it has undertaken any assessment of such due diligence processes or whether it has relied on a third-party assessment, indicating how the outcome of such assessment impacts on the credit rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a credit rating agency issues credit ratings of structured finance instruments, it shall accompany the disclosure of methodologies, models and key rating assumptions with guidance which explains assumptions, parameters, limits and uncertainties surrounding the models and rating methodologies used in such credit ratings, including simulations of stress scenarios undertaken by the agencies when establishing the ratings. Such guidance shall be clear and easily comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit rating agency shall disclose, on an ongoing basis, information about all structured finance products submitted to it for their initial review or for preliminary rating. Such disclosure shall be made whether or not issuers contract with the credit rating agency for a final rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a credit rating agency issues a sovereign rating or a related rating outlook, it shall simultaneously provide a detailed research report explaining all the assumptions, parameters, limits and uncertainties and any other information taken into account in determining that sovereign rating or rating outlook. That report shall be publicly available, clear and easily comprehensible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A publicly available research report accompanying a change compared to the previous sovereign rating or related rating outlook shall include at least the following:&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a detailed evaluation of the changes to the quantitative assumption justifying the reasons for the rating change and their relative weight. The detailed evaluation should include a description of the following: per capita income, GDP Growth, inflation, fiscal balance, external balance, external debt, an indicator for economic development, an indicator for default and any other relevant factor taken into account. This should be complemented with the relative weight of each factor;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a detailed evaluation of the changes to the qualitative assumption justifying the reasons for the rating change and their relative weight;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a detailed description of the risks, limits and uncertainties related to the rating change; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a summary of minutes of the meeting of the rating committee that decided on the rating change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to point 3 of Part I of Section D of Annex I, where a credit rating agency issues sovereign ratings or related rating outlooks, it shall publish them in accordance with Article 8a, after the close of business hours of regulated markets and at least one hour before their opening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to point 5 of Part I of Section D of Annex I, in accordance with which, when announcing a credit rating, a credit rating agency is to explain in its press releases or reports the key elements underlying the credit rating and although national policies may serve as an element underlying a sovereign rating, policy recommendations, prescriptions or guidelines to rated entities, including States or regional or local authorities of States, shall not be part of sovereign ratings or rating outlooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
