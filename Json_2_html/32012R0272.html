&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;annual supervisory fees according to Article 5;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;registration fees according to Article 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit rating agencies established in third countries that apply for certification in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 shall be charged the following types of fees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flat annual supervisory fees according to Article 7;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;certification fees according to Article 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fees shall be payable in Euro. They shall be payable as specified in Articles 5(3), 6(6), 7(2) and 8(2).&lt;br&gt;Any late payments shall incur a daily penalty equal to 0,1 % of the amount due.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Types of fees and general payment modalities</td><td>Article 4</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A registered credit rating agency shall be charged an annual supervisory fee.&lt;br&gt;By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, a registered credit rating agency shall be exempted from paying an annual supervisory fee where its total revenues as published in its most recent audited accounts is less than EUR 10 million, or in case it belongs to a group of credit rating agencies, where the group of credit rating agencies has aggregate total revenues of less than EUR 10 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual supervisory fee for a given financial year shall be calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the basis for the calculation of the annual supervisory fee for a given financial year shall be the estimate of expenditure relating to the supervision of credit rating agencies as included in the ESMA budget for that year, set out and approved in accordance with Article 63 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relevant amount for the calculation of the annual supervisory fee for a given financial year shall be the estimate of expenditure according to point (a) reduced by any annual supervisory fees to be charged to certified credit rating agencies for a given financial year according to Article 7 and increased by any deficit from the previous financial year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a registered credit rating agency as referred to in paragraph 1 shall pay as an annual supervisory fee a part of the relevant amount which corresponds to the ratio of the credit rating agencyâ€™s applicable turnover to the total applicable turnover of all registered credit rating agencies required to pay an annual supervisory fee in accordance with paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The annual supervisory fee for a given financial year shall be paid in two instalments.&lt;br&gt;The first instalment shall be due by the end of February of that year and shall amount to two thirds of the estimated annual supervisory fee. If the applicable turnover is not yet available at that time, ESMA shall base the calculation on the turnover included in the most recent audited accounts available.&lt;br&gt;The second instalment shall be due by the end of August. The amount of the second instalment shall be the annual supervisory fee calculated according to paragraph 2 reduced by the amount of the first instalment.&lt;br&gt;ESMA shall send the invoices for the instalments to the credit rating agencies at least 30 days before the respective payment date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Annual supervisory fee for registered credit rating agencies</td><td>Article 5</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of the registration fee to be paid by individual credit rating agencies applying for registration shall be proportionate to the complexity of the application and the size of the credit rating agency as specified in paragraphs 2 to 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of calculating the amount of the registration fee, the following criteria shall be taken into consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether a credit rating agency intends to issue ratings for structured finance instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether a credit rating agency has a branch in another Member State or in a third country;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether a credit rating agency intends to endorse ratings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where none of the criteria set out in paragraph 2 apply, the registration fees shall be calculated according to the number of employees, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with fewer than 15 employees shall pay EUR 2000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with 15 to 49 employees shall pay EUR 15000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with at least 50 employees shall pay EUR 40000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit rating agencies that only meet one of the criteria set out in paragraph 2 shall pay the following registration fees according to the number of their employees, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with fewer than 15 employees shall pay EUR 10000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with 15 to 49 employees shall pay EUR 40000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with at least 50 employees shall pay EUR 100000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit rating agencies that meet at least two of the criteria set out in paragraph 2 shall pay the following registration fees according to the number of their employees, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with fewer than 15 employees shall pay EUR 30000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with 15 to 49 employees shall pay EUR 85000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit rating agencies with at least 50 employees shall pay EUR 125000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The registration fee shall be payable in full at the time the credit rating agency applies for registration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a credit rating agency withdraws its application for registration before ESMA has notified it that the application is complete in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, ESMA shall reimburse three quarters of the registration fee paid. If the application is withdrawn after this date, but before ESMA adopts the reasoned decision to register or refuse registration, ESMA shall reimburse one quarter of the registration fee paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By way of derogation from Article 5, a registered credit rating agency that is required to pay an annual supervisory fee in accordance with Article 5(1) shall pay in the year of its registration an initial supervisory fee of EUR 500 for each complete month in the time period between the date of registration and the end of the financial year. This fee shall be payable in full once the registration is notified to the credit rating agency.&lt;/li&gt;
