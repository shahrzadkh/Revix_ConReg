&lt;li&gt;regulatory requirements under Union law that are applicable to the relevant insurance-based investment product or activity do not address the threat;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a competent authority or competent authorities have not taken action to address the threat or the actions that have been taken do not adequately address the threat.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;EIOPA shall publish on its website notice of any decision to take any action under this Article. The notice shall specify details of the prohibition or restriction and specify a time after the publication of the notice from which the measures will take effect. A prohibition or restriction shall only apply to action taken after the measures take effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EIOPA shall review a prohibition or restriction imposed under paragraph 1 at appropriate intervals and at least every three months. If the prohibition or restriction is not renewed after that three-month period it shall expire.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A competent authority may take the action referred to in paragraph 1 if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an insurance-based investment product, or activity or practice gives rise to significant investor protection concerns or poses a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of whole or part of the financial system within at least one Member State;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;existing regulatory requirements under Union law applicable to the insurance-based investment product, or activity or practice do not sufficiently address the risks referred to in point (a) and the issue would not be better addressed by improved supervision or enforcement of existing requirements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the action is proportionate taking into account the nature of the risks identified, the level of sophistication of investors or market participants concerned and the likely effect of the action on investors and market participants who may hold, use or benefit from the insurance-based investment product, or activity or practice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the competent authority has properly consulted competent authorities in other Member States that may be significantly affected by the action; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the action does not have a discriminatory effect on services or activities provided from another Member State.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where the conditions set out in the first subparagraph are fulfilled, the competent authority may impose the prohibition or restriction referred to in paragraph 1 on a precautionary basis before an insurance-based investment product has been marketed or sold to investors. A prohibition or restriction may apply in circumstances, or be subject to exceptions, specified by the competent authority.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competent authority shall not impose a prohibition or restriction under this Article unless, not less than one month before the measure is intended to take effect, it has notified all other competent authorities involved and EIOPA in writing or through another medium agreed between the authorities of the details of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In exceptional cases where the competent authority deems it necessary to take urgent action under this Article in order to prevent detriment arising from the insurance-based investment products, activities or practices referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority may take action on a provisional basis with no less than 24 hours&#x27; written notice before the measure is intended to take effect to all other competent authorities and EIOPA, provided that all the criteria in this Article are met and that, in addition, it is clearly established that a one-month notification period would not adequately address the specific concern or threat. The competent authority shall not take action on a provisional basis for a period exceeding three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authority shall publish on its website notice of any decision to impose any prohibition or restriction referred to in paragraph 1. That notice shall specify details of the prohibition or restriction, a time after the publication of the notice from which the measures will take effect and the evidence upon which it is satisfied each of the conditions in paragraph 2 are met. The prohibition or restriction shall only apply in relation to action taken after the publication of the notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authority shall revoke a prohibition or restriction if the conditions in paragraph 2 no longer apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30 specifying criteria and factors to be taken into account by competent authorities in determining when there is a significant investor protection concern or a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or to the stability of the financial system within at least one Member State referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those criteria and factors shall include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After receiving notification under Article 17 of any action that is to be imposed under that Article, EIOPA shall adopt an opinion on whether the prohibition or restriction is justified and proportionate.

The review shall also reflect on a possible extension of the scope of this Regulation to other financial products, and shall assess whether the exemption of products from the scope of this Regulation should be maintained, in view of sound standards for consumer protection including comparisons between financial products. The review shall also assess the appropriateness of introducing common rules on the need for all Member States to provide for administrative sanctions for infringements of this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Commission shall assess, by 31 December 2019, on the basis of the work undertaken by EIOPA on disclosure of product information requirements, whether to propose a new legislative act guaranteeing appropriate disclosure of product information requirements for those products or whether to include pension products referred to in point (e) of Article 2 (2) in the scope of this Regulation.&lt;br&gt;In making its assessment, the Commission shall ensure that such measures do not reduce standards of disclosure in Member States that have pre-existing disclosure regimes for such pension products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After consulting the Joint Committee, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council relating to paragraphs 1 and 2, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 31 December 2019, the Commission shall conduct a market survey to determine whether online calculator tools which allow the retail investor to compute the aggregate costs and fees of PRIIPs are available and whether they are free of charge. The Commission shall report on whether those tools provide for reliable and accurate calculations for all products within the scope of this Regulation.&lt;br&gt;In the event that the survey concludes that no such tools exist or that existing tools do not enable retail investors to understand the aggregate amount of costs and fees of PRIIPS, the Commission shall assess the feasibility of the ESAs, through the Joint Committee, developing draft regulatory technical standards setting out the specifications applicable to such Union-level tools.&lt;/li&gt;
