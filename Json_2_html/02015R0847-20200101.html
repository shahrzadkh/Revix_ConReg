&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that legal persons can be held liable for the breaches referred to in Article 18 committed for their benefit by any person acting individually or as part of an organ of that legal person, and having a leading position within the legal person based on any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power to represent the legal person;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;authority to exercise control within the legal person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall also ensure that legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article has made it possible to commit one of the breaches referred to in Article 18 for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competent authorities shall exercise their powers to impose administrative sanctions and measures in accordance with this Regulation in any of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;under their responsibility by delegation to such other authorities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by application to the competent judicial authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
