&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding point (c) of paragraph 2, this Directive shall apply to unsecured credit agreements the purpose of which is the renovation of a residential immovable property involving a total amount of credit above EUR 75000.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member States may determine that only Articles 1 to 4, 6, 7 and 9, Article 10(1), points (a) to (h) and (l) of Article 10(2), Article 10(4) and Articles 11, 13 and 16 to 32 shall apply to credit agreements which are concluded by an organisation which:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is established for the mutual benefit of its members;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not make profits for any other person than its members;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and whose membership is restricted to persons residing or employed in a particular location or employees and retired employees of a particular employer, or to persons meeting other qualifications laid down under national law as the basis for the existence of a common bond between the members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States may exempt from the application of this Directive credit agreements concluded by such an organisation where the total value of all existing credit agreements entered into by the organisation is insignificant in relation to the total value of all existing credit agreements in the Member State in which the organisation is based and the total value of all existing credit agreements entered into by all such organisations in the Member State is less than 1 % of the total value of all existing credit agreements entered into in that Member State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States shall each year review whether the conditions for the application of any such exemption continue to exist and shall take action to withdraw the exemption where they consider that the conditions are no longer met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member States may determine that only Articles 1 to 4, 6, 7, 9, Article 10(1), points (a) to (i), (l) and (r) of Article 10(2), Article 10(4), Articles 11, 13, 16 and Articles 18 to 32 shall apply to credit agreements which provide for arrangements to be agreed by the creditor and the consumer in respect of deferred payment or repayment methods, where the consumer is already in default on the initial credit agreement and where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such arrangements would be likely to avert the possibility of legal proceedings concerning such default; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the consumer would not thereby be subject to terms less favourable than those laid down in the initial credit agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the credit agreement falls within the scope of paragraph 3, only the provisions of that paragraph shall apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consumer means a natural person who, in transactions covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business or profession;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creditor means a natural or legal person who grants or promises to grant credit in the course of his trade, business or profession;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit agreement means an agreement whereby a creditor grants or promises to grant to a consumer credit in the form of a deferred payment, loan or other similar financial accommodation, except for agreements for the provision on a continuing basis of services or for the supply of goods of the same kind, where the consumer pays for such services or goods for the duration of their provision by means of instalments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overdraft facility means an explicit credit agreement whereby a creditor makes available to a consumer funds which exceed the current balance in the consumer&#x27;s current account;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;credit intermediary means a natural or legal person who is not acting as a creditor and who, in the course of his trade, business or profession, for a fee, which may take a pecuniary form or any other agreed form of financial consideration:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presents or offers credit agreements to consumers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assists consumers by undertaking preparatory work in respect of credit agreements other than as referred to in (i); or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concludes credit agreements with consumers on behalf of the creditor;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;fixed borrowing rate means that the creditor and the consumer agree in the credit agreement on one borrowing rate for the entire duration of the credit agreement or on several borrowing rates for partial periods using exclusively a fixed specific percentage. If not all borrowing rates are determined in the credit agreement, the borrowing rate shall be deemed to be fixed only for the partial periods for which the borrowing rates are determined exclusively by a fixed specific percentage agreed on the conclusion of the credit agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total amount of credit means the ceiling or the total sums made available under a credit agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;durable medium means any instrument which enables the consumer to store information addressed personally to him in a way accessible for future reference for a period of time adequate for the purposes of the information and which allows the unchanged reproduction of the information stored;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;linked credit agreement means a credit agreement where&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit in question serves exclusively to finance an agreement for the supply of specific goods or the provision of a specific service, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those two agreements form, from an objective point of view, a commercial unit; a commercial unit shall be deemed to exist where the supplier or service provider himself finances the credit for the consumer or, if it is financed by a third party, where the creditor uses the services of the supplier or service provider in connection with the conclusion or preparation of the credit agreement, or where the specific goods or the provision of a specific service are explicitly specified in the credit agreement.&lt;/li&gt;

This provision shall not apply if the creditor is at the time of the request unwilling to proceed to the conclusion of the credit agreement with the consumer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of a credit agreement under which payments made by the consumer do not give rise to an immediate corresponding amortisation of the total amount of credit, but are used to constitute capital during periods and under conditions laid down in the credit agreement or in an ancillary agreement, the pre-contractual information required under paragraph 1 shall include a clear and concise statement that such credit agreements do not provide for a guarantee of repayment of the total amount of credit drawn down under the credit agreement, unless such a guarantee is given.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to give effect to the withdrawal before the expiry of the deadline referred to in paragraph 1, notify this to the creditor in line with the information given by the creditor pursuant to Article 10(2)(p) by means which can be proven in accordance with national law. The deadline shall be deemed to have been met if that notification, if it is on paper or on another durable medium that is available and accessible to the creditor, is dispatched before the deadline expires; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay to the creditor the capital and the interest accrued thereon from the date the credit was drawn down until the date the capital is repaid, without any undue delay and no later than 30 calendar days after the despatch by him to the creditor of notification of the withdrawal. The interest shall be calculated on the basis of the agreed borrowing rate. The creditor shall not be entitled to any other compensation from the consumer in the event of withdrawal, except compensation for any non-returnable charges paid by the creditor to any public administrative body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If an ancillary service relating to the credit agreement is provided by the creditor or by a third party on the basis of an agreement between the third party and the creditor, the consumer shall no longer be bound by the ancillary service contract if the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal from the credit agreement in accordance with this Article.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where the goods or services covered by a linked credit agreement are not supplied, or are supplied only in part, or are not in conformity with the contract for the supply thereof, the consumer shall have the right to pursue remedies against the creditor if the consumer has pursued his remedies against the supplier but has failed to obtain the satisfaction to which he is entitled according to the law or the contract for the supply of goods or services. Member States shall determine to what extent and under what conditions those remedies shall be exercisable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Article shall be without prejudice to any national rules rendering the creditor jointly and severally liable in respect of any claim which the consumer may have against the supplier where the purchase of goods or services from the supplier has been financed by a credit agreement.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the event of early repayment of credit the creditor shall be entitled to fair and objectively justified compensation for possible costs directly linked to early repayment of credit provided that the early repayment falls within a period for which the borrowing rate is fixed.Such compensation may not exceed 1 % of the amount of credit repaid early, if the period of time between the early repayment and the agreed termination of the credit agreement exceeds one year. If the period does not exceed one year, the compensation may not exceed 0,5 % of the amount of credit repaid early.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the creditor may exceptionally claim higher compensation if he can prove that the loss he suffered from early repayment exceeds the amount determined under paragraph 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the compensation claimed by the creditor exceeds the loss actually suffered, the consumer may claim a corresponding reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the loss shall consist of the difference between the initially agreed interest rate and the interest rate at which the creditor can lend out the amount repaid early on the market at the time of early repayment, and shall take into account the impact of early repayment on administrative costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amounts paid by both parties at different times shall not necessarily be equal and shall not necessarily be paid at equal intervals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The starting date shall be that of the first drawdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intervals between dates used in the calculations shall be expressed in years or in fractions of a year. A year is presumed to have 365 days (or 366 days for leap years), 52 weeks or 12 equal months. An equal month is presumed to have 30,41666 days (i.e. 365/12) regardless of whether or not it is a leap year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result of the calculation shall be expressed with an accuracy of at least one decimal place. If the figure at the following decimal place is greater than or equal to 5, the figure at that particular decimal place shall be increased by one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The equation can be rewritten using a single sum and the concept of flows (Ak), which will be positive or negative, in other words either paid or received during periods 1 to k, expressed in years, i.e.:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#FORMULA#&lt;/p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S being the present balance of flows. If the aim is to maintain the equivalence of flows, the value will be zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a credit agreement gives the consumer freedom of drawdown, the total amount of credit shall be deemed to be drawn down immediately and in full.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a credit agreement gives the consumer freedom of drawdown in general but imposes, amongst the different ways of drawdown, a limitation with regard to the amount of credit and period of time, the amount of credit shall be deemed to be drawn down on the earliest date provided for in the credit agreement and in accordance with those drawdown limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a credit agreement provides different ways of drawdown with different charges or borrowing rates, the total amount of credit shall be deemed to be drawn down at the highest charge and borrowing rate applied to the most common drawdown mechanism for this type of credit agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of an overdraft facility, the total amount of credit shall be deemed to be drawn down in full and for the whole duration of the credit agreement. If the duration of the overdraft facility is not known, the annual percentage rate of charge shall be calculated on the assumption that the duration of the credit is 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of an open-end credit agreement, other than an overdraft facility, it shall be assumed that:&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit is provided for a period of 1 year starting from the date of the initial drawdown, and that the final payment made by the consumer clears the balance of capital, interest and other charges, if any;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the capital is repaid by the consumer in equal monthly payments, commencing 1 month after the date of the initial drawdown. However, in cases where the capital must be repaid only in full, in a single payment, within each payment period, successive drawdowns and repayments of the entire capital by the consumer shall be assumed to occur over the period of 1 year. Interest and other charges shall be applied in accordance with those drawdowns and repayments of capital and as provided for in the credit agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this point, an open-end credit agreement is a credit agreement without fixed duration and includes credits which must be repaid in full within or after a period but, once repaid, become available to be drawn down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of credit agreements other than overdrafts and open-end credits as referred to in the assumptions set out in points (d) and (e):&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the date or amount of a repayment of capital to be made by the consumer cannot be ascertained, it shall be assumed that the repayment is made at the earliest date provided for in the credit agreement and is for the lowest amount for which the credit agreement provides;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the date of conclusion of the credit agreement is not known, the date of the initial drawdown shall be assumed to be the date which results in the shortest interval between that date and the date of the first payment to be made by the consumer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the date or amount of a payment to be made by the consumer cannot be ascertained on the basis of the credit agreement or the assumptions set out in points (d), (e) or (f), it shall be assumed that the payment is made in accordance with the dates and conditions required by the creditor and, when these are unknown:&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest charges are paid together with the repayments of capital;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a non-interest charge expressed as a single sum is paid at the date of the conclusion of the credit agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-interest charges expressed as several payments are paid at regular intervals, commencing with the date of the first repayment of capital, and if the amount of such payments is not known they shall be assumed to be equal amounts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the final payment clears the balance of capital, interest and other charges, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the ceiling applicable to the credit has not yet been agreed, that ceiling is assumed to be EUR 1500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If different borrowing rates and charges are offered for a limited period or amount, the borrowing rate and the charges shall be deemed to be the highest rate for the whole duration of the credit agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For consumer credit agreements for which a fixed borrowing rate is agreed in relation to the initial period, at the end of which a new borrowing rate is determined and subsequently periodically adjusted according to an agreed indicator, the calculation of the annual percentage rate shall be based on the assumption that, at the end of the fixed borrowing rate period, the borrowing rate is the same as at the time of calculating the annual percentage rate, based on the value of the agreed indicator at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
