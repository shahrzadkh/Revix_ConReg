&lt;p&gt;A trade repository shall verify all of the following in a received SFT report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the identity of the report submitting entity as referred to in Field 2 of Table 1 of Annex I to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/363Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/363 of 13 December 2018 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to the format and frequency of reports on the details of securities financing transactions (SFTs) to trade repositories in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1247/2012 with regard to the use of reporting codes in the reporting of derivative contracts (See page 85 of this Official Journal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the XML template used to report an SFT complies with the ISO 20022 methodology in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/363;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the report submitting entity, if different from the reporting counterparty as referred to in Field 3 of Table 1 of Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/363, is duly authorised to report on behalf of the reporting counterparty, except in the case provided for in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2365;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the same SFT report has not been submitted previously;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that an SFT report with action type Modification relates to a previously submitted SFT report;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that an SFT report with action type Modification does not relate to an SFT that has been reported as cancelled;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the SFT report does not include the action type New in respect of an SFT that has been reported already;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the SFT report does not include the action type Position component in respect of an SFT that has been reported already;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the SFT report does not purport to modify the details of the report submitting entity, the reporting counterparty or the other counterparty to a previously reported SFT;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the SFT report does not purport to modify an existing SFT report by specifying a value date later than the reported maturity date of the SFT;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the correctness and completeness of the SFT report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trade repository shall verify whether information about collateral has been reported in Fields 73 to 96 of Table 2 of Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/363 for SFTs where Field 72 Uncollateralised SL flag of that same Table is reported as false. The trade repository shall notify, in accordance with Article 3 of this Regulation, the report submitting entity and the reporting counterparty as well as the entity responsible for reporting, if applicable, of the result of the verification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trade repository shall reject an SFT report that does not comply with one of the requirements set out in paragraph 1 and assign to it one of the rejection categories set out in Table 2 of Annex I to this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trade repository shall provide the report submitting entity and the reporting counterparty as well as the entity responsible for reporting, if applicable, with detailed information on the results of the data verification referred to in paragraph 1 within sixty minutes after it has received an SFT report. A trade repository shall provide those results in an XML format and a template developed in accordance with the ISO 20022 methodology. The results shall include, where applicable, the specific reasons for the rejection of an SFT report in accordance with paragraph 3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the trade repository has completed the verifications set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where all the conditions of paragraph 1 are met, a trade repository shall undertake the following steps, while using the latest reported value for each of the fields in Table 1 of Annex I to this Regulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository having received an SFT report shall verify whether it has received a corresponding SFT report from or on behalf of the other counterparty;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository that has not received a corresponding SFT report as referred to in point (a) shall attempt to identify the trade repository that has received the corresponding SFT report by communicating to all registered trade repositories the values of the following fields of the reported SFT: Unique Transaction Identifier, Reporting counterparty, Other counterparty and Master agreement type;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository that determines that another trade repository has received a corresponding SFT report as referred to in point (a) shall exchange with that trade repository the details of the reported SFT in an XML format and a template developed in accordance with the ISO 20022 methodology;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subject to point (e), a trade repository shall treat a reported SFT as reconciled where the details of that SFT match the details of the corresponding SFT report as referred to in point (a) of this paragraph;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository shall seek to match separately the fields pertaining to the loan data and the fields pertaining to the collateral data of a reported SFT in accordance with the tolerance limits and relevant dates of application laid down in Table 1 of Annex I to this Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository shall subsequently assign values for the reconciliation categories for each reported SFT, as set out in Table 3 of Annex I to this Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository shall conclude the steps in points (a) to (f) of this paragraph at the earliest opportunity and shall take no such steps after 18:00 Universal Coordinated Time on a given working day;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trade repository that cannot reconcile a reported SFT shall seek to match the details of that reported SFT on the following working day. The trade repository shall no longer seek to reconcile the reported SFT thirty calendar days after the reported maturity of the SFT or after the trade repository has received a report relating to it with action type Termination or Position component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trade repository shall confirm the total number of reconciled, reported SFTs with each trade repository with which it has reconciled reported SFTs at the end of each working day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No later than sixty minutes after the conclusion of the reconciliation process as set out in point (g) of paragraph 2, a trade repository shall provide the report submitting entity and the reporting counterparty as well as the entity responsible for reporting, if applicable, with the results of the reconciliation process performed by it on the reported SFTs. A trade repository shall provide those results in an XML format and a template developed in accordance with the ISO 20022 methodology, including information on the fields that have not been reconciled.&lt;/li&gt;
