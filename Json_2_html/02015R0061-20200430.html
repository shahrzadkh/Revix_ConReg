&lt;li&gt;In order to qualify as liquid assets, the assets of a credit institution shall comply with paragraphs 2 to 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assets shall be a property, right, entitlement, or interest, that is held by the credit institution, or included in a pool as referred to in point (a), and is free from any encumbrance. For those purposes, an asset shall be deemed to be unencumbered where it is not subject to any legal, contractual, regulatory or other restriction preventing the credit institution from liquidating, selling, transferring, assigning or, generally, disposing of the asset via an outright sale or a repurchase agreement within the following 30 calendar days. The following assets shall be deemed to be unencumbered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed but not yet funded credit lines available to the credit institution or, if the pool is operated by a central bank, under uncommitted and not yet funded credit lines available to the credit institution. This point shall include assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme. Credit institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in Chapter 2, starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assets that the credit institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in reverse repo or securities financing transactions and that the credit institution may dispose of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assets shall not have been issued by the credit institution itself, its parent undertaking, other than a public sector entity that is not a credit institution, its subsidiary or another subsidiary of its parent undertaking or by a securitisation special purpose entity with which the credit institution has close links;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assets shall not have been issued by any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another credit institution, unless one or more of the following conditions is met:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the issuer is a public sector entity referred to in point (c) of Article 10(1) or in point (a) or (b) of Article 11(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the asset is a covered bond referred to in point (f) of Article 10(1) or in point (c) or (d) of Article 11(1) or in point (e) of Article 12(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the asset belongs to the category described in point (e) of Article 10(1);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a mixed financial holding company;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any other entity that performs one or more of the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU as its main business. For the purposes of this Article, SSPEs shall be deemed not included within the entities referred to in this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of the assets shall be capable of being determined on the basis of widely disseminated and easily available market prices. In the absence of market-based prices, the value of the assets must be capable of being determined on the basis of an easy-to-calculate formula that uses publicly available inputs and is not significantly dependent upon strong assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assets shall be listed on a recognised exchange or tradable via active outright sale or via simple repurchase transaction on generally accepted repurchase markets. These criteria shall be assessed separately for each market. An asset admitted to trading in an organised venue which is not a recognised exchange, either in a Member State or in a third country, shall be deemed liquid only where the trading venue provides for an active and sizable market for outright sales of assets. The credit institution shall take into account the following as minimum criteria to assess whether a trading venue provides for an active and sizeable market for the purposes of this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;historical evidence of market breadth and depth as proven by low bid-ask spreads, high trading volume and a large and diverse number of market participants;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>General requirements for liquid assets</td><td>Article 7</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions shall have policies and limits in place to ensure that the holdings of liquid assets comprising their liquidity buffer remain appropriately diversified at all times. For those purposes, credit institutions shall take into account the extent of diversification between the various categories of liquid assets and within the same category of liquid assets referred to in Chapter 2 of this Title and any other relevant diversification factors, such as types of issuers, counterparties or the geographical location of those issuers and counterparties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competent authorities may impose specific restrictions or requirements on a credit institution&#x27;s holdings of liquid assets to ensure compliance with the requirement set out in this paragraph. Any such restriction or requirement, however, shall not apply to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the following categories of level 1 assets:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banknotes and coins referred to in Article 10(1)(a);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exposures to central banks referred to in points (b) and (d) of Article 10(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assets representing claims on or guaranteed by the multilateral developments banks and international organisations referred to in Article 10(1)(g);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the categories of level 1 assets representing claims on or guaranteed by the central or regional governments, local authorities or public sector entities referred to Article 10(1)(c) and (d), provided that the credit institution holds the relevant asset to cover stressed net liquidity outflows incurred in the currency of the Member State or third country or the asset is issued by the central or regional governments, local authorities or public sector entities of the credit institution&#x27;s home Member State;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the restricted-use committed liquidity facility referred to in point (d) of Article 12(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions shall have ready access to their holdings of liquid assets and be able to monetise them at any time during the 30 calendar day stress period via outright sale or repurchase agreement on generally accepted repurchase markets. A liquid asset shall be deemed readily accessible to a credit institution where there are no legal or practical impediments to the credit institution&#x27;s ability to monetise such an asset in a timely fashion.&lt;br&gt;Assets used to provide credit enhancement in structured transactions or to cover operational costs of the credit institutions shall not be deemed as readily accessible to a credit institution.&lt;br&gt;Assets held in a third country where there are restrictions to their free transferability shall be deemed readily accessible only insofar as the credit institution uses those assets to meet liquidity outflows in that third country. Assets held in a non-convertible currency shall be deemed readily accessible only insofar as the credit institution uses those assets to meet liquidity outflows in that currency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit institutions shall ensure that their liquid assets are under the control of a specific liquidity management function within the credit institution. Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated to the competent authority either by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;placing the liquid assets in a separate pool under the direct management of the liquidity function and with the sole intent of using them as a source of contingent funds, including during stress periods;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;putting in place internal systems and controls to give the liquidity management function effective operational control to monetise the holdings of liquid assets at any point in the 30 calendar day stress period and to access the contingent funds without directly conflicting with any existing business or risk management strategies. In particular, an asset shall not be included in the liquidity buffer where monetisation of the asset without replacement throughout the 30 calendar day stress period would remove a hedge that would create an open risk position in excess of the internal limits of the credit institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a combination of options (a) and (b), provided that the competent authority has deemed such combination acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit institutions shall regularly, and at least once a year, monetise a sufficiently representative sample of their holdings of liquid assets by means of outright sale or simple repurchase agreement on a generally accepted repurchase market. Credit institutions shall develop strategies for disposing of samples of liquid assets which are adequate to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test the access to the market for those assets and their usability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check that the credit institution&#x27;s processes for the timely monetisation of assets are effective;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimise the risk of sending a negative signal to the market as a result of the credit institution&#x27;s monetising its assets during stress periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The requirement laid down in the first subparagraph shall not apply to level 1 assets referred to in Article 10, other than extremely high quality covered bonds, to the restricted-use committed liquidity facility referred to in subparagraph (d) of Article 12(1) or to the deposits and other liquidity funding in cooperatives networks and institutional protection schemes referred to in Article 16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement set out in paragraph 2 shall not prevent credit institutions from hedging the market risk associated with their liquid assets provided that the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit institution puts in place appropriate internal arrangements in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 to ensure that those assets continue to be readily available and under the control of the liquidity management function;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the net liquidity outflows and inflows that would result in the event of an early close-out of the hedge are taken into account in the valuation of the relevant asset in accordance with Article 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit institutions shall ensure that the currency denomination of their liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of their net liquidity outflows. However, where appropriate, competent authorities may require credit institutions to restrict currency mismatch by setting limits on the proportion of net liquidity outflows in a currency that can be met during a stress period by holding liquid assets not denominated in that currency. That restriction may only be applied for the reporting currency or a currency that may be subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In determining the level of any restriction on currency mismatch that may be applied in accordance with this paragraph, competent authorities shall at least have regard to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the credit institution has the ability to do any of the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the liquid assets to generate liquidity in the currency and jurisdiction in which the net liquidity outflows arise;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swap currencies and raise funds in foreign currency markets during stressed conditions consistent with the 30 calendar day stress period set out in Article 4;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transfer a liquidity surplus from one currency to another and across jurisdictions and legal entities within its group during stressed conditions consistent with the 30 calendar day stress period set out in Article 4;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the impact of sudden, adverse exchange rate movements on existing mismatched positions and on the effectiveness of any foreign exchange hedges in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Any restriction on currency mismatch imposed in accordance with this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute a specific liquidity requirement as referred to in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The securitisation position and the exposures underlying the position shall meet all the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the position has been assigned a credit assessment of credit quality step 1 by a nominated ECAI in accordance with Article 264 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or the equivalent credit quality step in the event of a short-term credit assessment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the position is in the most senior tranche or tranches of the securitisation and possesses the highest level of seniority at all times during the ongoing life of the transaction. For these purposes, a tranche shall be deemed to be the most senior where after the delivery of an enforcement notice and where applicable an acceleration notice, the tranche is not subordinated to other tranches of the same securitisation transaction or scheme in respect of receiving principal and interest payments, without taking into account amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees or other similar payments in accordance with Article 242(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the underlying exposures have been acquired by the SSPE within the meaning of Article 4(1)(66) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in a manner that is enforceable against any third party and are beyond the reach of the seller (originator, sponsor or original lender) and its creditors including in the event of the seller&#x27;s insolvency;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the transfer of the underlying exposures to the SSPE may not be subject to any severe clawback provisions in the jurisdiction where the seller (originator, sponsor or original lender) is incorporated. This includes but is not limited to provisions under which the sale of the underlying exposures can be invalidated by the liquidator of the seller (originator, sponsor or original lender) solely on the basis that it was concluded within a certain period before the declaration of the seller&#x27;s insolvency or provisions where the SSPE can prevent such invalidation only if it can prove that it was not aware of the insolvency of the seller at the time of sale;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the underlying exposures have their administration governed by a servicing agreement which includes servicing continuity provisions that ensure, at a minimum, that a default or insolvency of the servicer does not result in a termination of servicing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the documentation governing the securitisation includes continuity provisions that ensure, at a minimum, the replacement of derivative counterparties and of liquidity providers upon their default or insolvency, where applicable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the securitisation position is backed by a pool of underlying exposures and those underlying exposures either all belong to only one of the following subcategories or else they consist of a combination of residential loans referred to in point (i) and residential loans referred to in point (ii):&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the national law of the Member State where the loans were originated provides for a loan-to-income limit on the amount that an obligor may borrow in a residential loan, and that Member State has notified this law to the Commission and EBA. The loan-to-income limit is calculated on the gross annual income of the obligor, taking into account the tax obligations and other commitments of the obligor and the risk of changes in the interest rates over the term of the loan. For each residential loan in the pool, the percentage of the obligor&#x27;s gross income that may be spent to service the loan, including interest, principal and fee payments, does not exceed 45 %;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Where the originator, sponsor and original lender are established outside the Union, comprehensive loan-level data in compliance with standards generally accepted by market participants are made available to existing and potential investors and regulators at issuance and on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underlying exposures shall not have been originated by the credit institution holding the securitisation position in its liquidity buffer, its subsidiary, its parent undertaking, a subsidiary of its parent undertaking or any other undertaking closely linked with that credit institution.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquidity outflows referred to in paragraph 1 shall include, in each case multiplied by the applicable outflow rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current outstanding amount for stable retail deposits and other retail deposits determined in accordance with Articles 24 and 25;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current outstanding amounts of other liabilities that become due, can be called for pay-out by the issuer or by the provider of the funding or entail an expectation by the provider of the funding that the credit institution would repay the liability during the next 30 calendar days determined in accordance with Articles 27, 28 and 31a;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the additional outflows determined in accordance with Article 30;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The outflows referred to in paragraph 1 shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress as referred to in Article 5. For that assessment, credit institutions shall particularly take into account material reputational damage that could result from not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Credit institutions shall report at least once a year to the competent authorities those products and services for which the likelihood and potential volume of the liquidity outflows referred to in paragraph 1 are material and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned. The competent authorities may apply an outflow rate of up to 5 % for trade finance off-balance sheet related products as referred to in Article 429 and Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities shall at least once a year report to the EBA the types of products or services for which they have determined outflows on the basis of the reports from credit institutions, and shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine the outflows.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has an active contractual relationship with the credit institution of at least 12 months duration;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of derogation from paragraph 1, from 1 January 2019 competent authorities may authorise credit institutions to multiply by 3 % the amount of the stable retail deposits referred to in paragraph 1 covered by a deposit guarantee scheme in accordance with Directive 2014/49/EU up to a maximum level of EUR 100000 as specified in Article 6(1) of that Directive, provided that the Commission has confirmed that the officially recognised deposit guarantee scheme meets all of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deposit guarantee scheme has available financial means, as referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2014/49/EU, raised ex ante by contributions made by members at least annually;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deposit guarantee scheme has adequate means of ensuring ready access to additional funding in the event of a large call on its reserves, including access to extraordinary contributions from member credit institutions and adequate alternative funding arrangements to obtain short-term funding from public or private third parties;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deposit guarantee scheme ensures a seven working day repayment period as referred to in Article 8(1) of Directive 2014/49/EU from the date of application of the 3 % outflow rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall only grant the authorisation referred to in paragraph 4 after having obtained prior approval from the Commission. Such approval shall be requested by means of a reasoned notification, which shall include evidence that the run-off rates for stable retail deposits would be below 3 % during any stress period experienced consistent with the scenarios referred to in Article 5. The reasoned notification shall be submitted to the Commission at least three months prior to the date from which authorisation is requested. The Commission shall assess the compliance of the relevant deposit guarantee scheme with the conditions set out in paragraph 4(a), (b) and (c). Where those conditions are fulfilled, the Commission shall approve the competent authority&#x27;s request to grant authorisation unless there exist overriding grounds for withholding approval having regard to the functioning of the internal market for retail deposits. All credit institutions affiliated to such an approved deposit guarantee scheme shall be entitled to apply the 3 % outflow rate. The Commission shall seek the opinion of the EBA on the conformity of the relevant deposit guarantee scheme with the conditions set out in paragraph 4(a), (b) and (c).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for credit institutions established in the Union, the depositor is resident in a third country or the deposit is denominated in a currency other than the euro or the domestic currency of a Member State. For credit institutions or branches in third countries, the depositor is a non-resident in the third country or the deposit is denominated in another currency than the domestic currency of the third country;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;where the retail deposits fulfil point (a) of paragraph 2 and at least another criterion referred to in paragraph 2, or three or more criteria of paragraph 2, an outflow rate of between 15 % and 20 % shall be applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;On a case by case basis, competent authorities may apply a higher outflow rate where justified by the specific circumstances of the credit institution. Credit institutions shall apply the outflow rate referred to in paragraph 3(b) to retail deposits where the assessment referred to paragraph 2 has not been carried out or is not completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit institutions may exclude from the calculation of outflows certain clearly circumscribed categories of retail deposits as long as in each and every instance the credit institution rigorously applies the following provisions for the whole category of those deposits, unless an exception can be justified on the basis of circumstances of hardship for the depositor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;within 30 calendar days, the depositor is not allowed to withdraw the deposit; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for early withdrawals within 30 calendar days, the depositor has to pay a penalty that includes the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and the contractual maturity date plus a material penalty that does not have to exceed the interest due for the time that elapsed between the date of deposit and the date of withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;If a portion of the deposit referred to in the first subparagraph can be withdrawn without incurring such a penalty, only that portion shall be treated as a demand deposit and the remaining balance shall be treated as a term deposit as referred to in this paragraph. An outflow rate of 100 % shall be applied to cancelled deposits with a residual maturity of less than 30 calendar days and where pay-out has been agreed to another credit institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By derogation from paragraphs 1 to 4 and Article 24, credit institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage outflow rate if such a percentage is provided for by the national law establishing liquidity requirements in that third country.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The credit institution shall calculate and notify to the competent authority an additional outflow for all contracts entered into, the contractual conditions of which lead, within 30 calendar days and following a material deterioration of the credit institution&#x27;s credit quality, to additional liquidity outflows or collateral needs. The credit institution shall notify the competent authority of that outflow no later than the submission of the reporting in accordance with Article 415 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where the competent authority considers that outflow to be material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the credit institution, it shall require the credit institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts corresponding to the additional collateral needs or cash outflows resulting from a material deterioration in the credit institution&#x27;s credit quality corresponding to a downgrade in its external credit assessment of at least three notches. The credit institution shall apply a 100 % outflow rate to those additional collateral or cash outflows. The credit institution shall regularly review the extent of this material deterioration in the light of what is relevant under the contracts that it has entered into and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on the credit institution&#x27;s derivatives transactions if material. This calculation shall be made in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/208Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/208 of 31 October 2016 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for additional liquidity outflows corresponding to collateral needs resulting from the impact of an adverse market scenario on an institution&#x27;s derivatives transactions (OJ L 33, 8.2.2017, p. 14)..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outflows and inflows expected over 30 calendar days from the contracts listed in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and from credit derivatives shall be taken into account on a net basis in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation. In the case of a net outflow, the credit institution shall multiply the result by a 100 % outflow rate. Credit institutions shall exclude from such calculations those liquidity requirements that result from the application of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the credit institution has a short position that is covered by an unsecured security borrowing, the credit institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to 100 % of the market value of the securities or other assets sold short, unless the terms upon which the credit institution has borrowed them require their return only after 30 calendar days. Where the short position is covered by a collateralised securities financing transaction, the credit institution shall assume the short position will be maintained throughout the 30 calendar day period and will receive a 0 % outflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to 100 % of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the excess collateral the credit institution holds that can be contractually called at any times by the counterparty;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collateral that is due to be posted to a counterparty within 30 calendar days;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collateral that corresponds to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Title II that can be substituted for assets corresponding to assets that would not qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Title II without the consent of the credit institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposits received as collateral shall not be considered as liabilities for the purposes of Article 24, 25, 27, 28 or 31a but shall be subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 6 of this Article, where applicable. The amount of cash received exceeding the amount of cash received as collateral shall be treated as deposits in accordance with Article 24, 25, 27, 28 or 31a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions shall assume a 100 % outflow for loss of funding on asset-backed securities, covered bonds and other structured financing instruments maturing within 30 calendar days, when these instruments are issued by the credit institution itself or by conduits or SPVs sponsored by the credit institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions shall assume a 100 % outflow for loss of funding on asset-backed commercial papers, conduits, securities investment vehicles and other such financing facilities. This 100 % outflow rate shall apply to the maturing amount or to the amount of assets that could potentially be returned or the liquidity required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For that portion of financing programs under paragraphs 8 and 9, credit institutions that are providers of associated liquidity facilities do not need to double count the maturing financing instrument and the liquidity facility for consolidated programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assets borrowed on an unsecured basis and maturing within 30 calendar days shall be assumed to run-off in full, leading to a 100 % outflow of liquid assets unless the credit institution owns the securities and they do not form part of the credit institution&#x27;s liquidity buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In relation to the provision of prime brokerage services, where a credit institution has covered the short sales of a client by internally matching them with the assets of another client and the assets do not qualify as liquid assets, those transactions shall be subject to a 50 % outflow rate for the contingent obligation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purpose of this Article, a liquidity facility shall be understood to mean any committed, undrawn back-up facility that would be utilised to refinance the debt obligations of a customer in situations where such a customer is unable to rollover that debt in financial markets. Its amount shall be calculated as the amount of the debt issued by the customer currently outstanding and maturing within 30 calendar days that is backstopped by the facility. The portion of the liquidity facility that is backing a debt that does not mature within 30 calendar days shall be excluded from the scope of the definition of the facility. Any additional capacity of the facility shall be treated as a committed credit facility with the associated drawdown rate as specified in this Article. General working capital facilities for corporate entities will not be classified as liquidity facilities, but as credit facilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit institutions shall calculate outflows for credit and liquidity facilities by multiplying the amount of the credit and liquidity facilities by the corresponding outflow rates set out in paragraphs 3 to 5. Outflows from committed credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn down within 30 calendar days, net of any liquidity requirement that would be applicable under Article 23 for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of any collateral made available to the credit institution and valued in accordance with Article 9, provided that the collateral fulfils all of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it may be reused or hypothecated by the credit institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is held in the form of liquid assets, but is not recognised as part of the liquidity buffer; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it does not consist in assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;If the necessary information is available to the credit institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn down for credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn down given the counterparty&#x27;s own obligations or given the pre-defined contractual drawdown schedule coming due over 30 calendar days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The maximum amount that can be drawn down from undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 calendar days shall be multiplied by 5 % if they qualify for the retail deposit exposure class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum amount that can be drawn down from undrawn committed credit facilities within 30 calendar days shall be multiplied by 10 % where they meet the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they do not qualify for the retail deposit exposure class;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers, including non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks and public sector entities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where the client is unable to obtain funding requirements in the financial markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The maximum amount that can be drawn down from undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 calendar days shall be multiplied by 30 % where they meet the conditions referred to in paragraph 4 points (a) and (b), and by 40 % when they are provided to personal investment companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The undrawn committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling that SSPE to purchase assets, other than securities, from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 % to the extent that it exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and where the maximum amount that can be drawn down is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central institution of a scheme or network referred to in Article 16 shall multiply by a 75 % outflow rate the liquidity funding committed to a member credit institution where such member credit institution may treat the liquidity funding as a liquid asset in accordance with Article 16(2). The 75 % outflow rate shall be applied on the committed principal amount of the liquidity funding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit institution shall multiply the maximum amount that can be drawn down from other undrawn committed credit and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within 30 calendar days by the corresponding outflow rate as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 % for credit and liquidity facilities extended to credit institutions and for credit facilities extended to other regulated financial institutions, including insurance undertakings and investment firms, CIUs or non-open ended investment scheme;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 % for liquidity facilities that the credit institution has granted to SSPEs other than those referred to in paragraph 6 and for arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 % for credit and liquidity facilities to financial customers not referred to in points (a) and (b) and paragraphs 1 to 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 to 8, credit institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by the central or regional government of at least one Member State may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 to credit and liquidity facilities that are extended to promotional lenders for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans, provided that those loans meet the requirements for the outflow rates referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4.&lt;br&gt;By way of derogation from point (g) of Article 32(3), where those promotional loans are extended as pass through loans via another credit institution acting as an intermediary, a symmetric inflow and outflow may be applied by the credit institution acting as an intermediary. That inflow and outflow shall be calculated by applying to the undrawn committed credit or liquidity facility received and extended the rate that is applicable to that facility by virtue of the first subparagraph of this paragraph and respecting the conditions and requirements otherwise imposed in relation to it by this paragraph.&lt;br&gt;The promotional loans referred to in this paragraph shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union or that Member State&#x27;s central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand provided there is a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds distributed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit institutions shall multiply by 100 % any liquidity outflows resulting from liabilities that become due in 30 calendar days other than those referred to in Articles 23 to 31.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;monies due from non-financial customers with a residual maturity of no more than 30 calendar days, with the exception of monies due from those customers from trade finance transactions or maturing securities, shall be reduced for the purposes of principal payment by 50 % of their value. For the purposes of this point, the term non-financial customers shall have the same meaning as in Article 31a(2). However, credit institutions acting as intermediaries that have received a commitment as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 31(9) from a credit institution set up and sponsored by the central or regional government of at least one Member State in order for them to disburse a promotional loan to a final recipient, or have received a similar commitment from a multilateral development bank or a public sector entity, may take an inflow into account up to the amount of the outflow that they apply to the corresponding commitment to extend those promotional loans;&lt;/li&gt;

For the purposes of this calculation, a 100 % haircut shall apply to assets that do not qualify as liquid assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the collateral obtained through reverse repos, securities borrowings, collateral swaps, or other transactions with a similar form, maturing within 30 calendar days is used to cover short positions that can be extended beyond 30 calendar days, the credit institution shall assume that such reverse repos, securities borrowings, collateral swaps or other transactions with a similar form will be rolled-over and will not give rise to any cash inflows reflecting the need to continue to cover the short position or to re-purchase the relevant securities. Short positions shall include both instances where in a matched book the credit institution sold short a security outright as part of a trading or hedging strategy and instances where in a matched book the credit institution has borrowed a security for a given period and lent the security out for a longer period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undrawn credit or liquidity facilities, including undrawn committed liquidity facilities from central banks, and other commitments received, other than those referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 31(9) and in Article 34, shall not be taken into account as an inflow;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monies due from securities issued by the credit institution itself or by a SSPE with which the credit institution has close links shall be taken into account on a net basis with an inflow rate applied on the basis of the inflow rate applicable to the underlying assets in accordance with this Article;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loans with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow rate, provided that the contract allows the credit institution to withdraw or to request payment within 30 calendar days.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Point (a) of paragraph 3 shall not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in points (2) and (3) of Article 192 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 that are collateralised by liquid assets in accordance with Title II as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3. Inflows from the release of balances held in segregated accounts in accordance with regulatory requirements for the protection of customer trading assets shall be taken into account in full, provided that those segregated balances are maintained in liquid assets as defined in Title II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outflows and inflows expected over 30 calendar days from the contracts listed in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and from credit derivatives shall be calculated on a net basis in accordance with Article 21 and shall be multiplied by a 100 % inflow rate in the event of a net inflow.&lt;/li&gt;
