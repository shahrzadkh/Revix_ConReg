&lt;li&gt;system shall mean a formal arrangement:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;between three or more participants, excluding the system operator of that system, a possible settlement agent, a possible central counterparty, a possible clearing house or a possible indirect participant, with common rules and standardised arrangements for the clearing, whether or not through a central counterparty, or execution of transfer orders between the participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;governed by the law of a Member State chosen by the participants; the participants may, however, only choose the law of a Member State in which at least one of them has its head office, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;designated, without prejudice to other more stringent conditions of general application laid down by national law, as a system and notified to the European Securities and Markets Authority by the Member State whose law is applicable, after that Member State is satisfied as to the adequacy of the rules of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to the conditions in the first subparagraph, a Member State may designate as a system such a formal arrangement whose business consists of the execution of transfer orders as defined in the second indent of (i) and which to a limited extent executes orders relating to other financial instruments, when that Member State considers that such a designation is warranted on grounds of systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Member State may also on a case-by-case basis designate as a system such a formal arrangement between two participants, without counting a possible settlement agent, a possible central counterparty, a possible clearing house or a possible indirect participant, when that Member State considers that such a designation is warranted on grounds of systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arrangement entered into between interoperable systems shall not constitute a system;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institution shall mean:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which participates in a system and which is responsible for discharging the financial obligations arising from transfer orders within that system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a system is supervised in accordance with national legislation and only executes transfer orders as defined in the second indent of (i), as well as payments resulting from such orders, a Member State may decide that undertakings which participate in such a system and which have responsibility for discharging the financial obligations arising from transfer orders within this system, can be considered institutions, provided that at least three participants of this system are covered by the categories referred to in the first subparagraph and that such a decision is warranted on grounds of systemic risk;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;transfer order shall mean:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;any instruction by a participant to place at the disposal of a recipient an amount of money by means of a book entry on the accounts of a credit institution, a central bank, a central counterparty or a settlement agent, or any instruction which results in the assumption or discharge of a payment obligation as defined by the rules of the system, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;an instruction by a participant to transfer the title to, or interest in, a security or securities by means of a book entry on a register, or otherwise;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Transfer orders and netting shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties even in the event of insolvency proceedings against a participant, provided that transfer orders were entered into the system before the moment of opening of such insolvency proceedings as defined in Article 6(1). This shall apply even in the event of insolvency proceedings against a participant (in the system concerned or in an interoperable system) or against the system operator of an interoperable system which is not a participant.Where transfer orders are entered into a system after the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings and are carried out within the business day, as defined by the rules of the system, during which the opening of such proceedings occur, they shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties only if the system operator can prove that, at the time that such transfer orders become irrevocable, it was neither aware, nor should have been aware, of the opening of such proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting aside of contracts and transactions concluded before the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings, as defined in Article 6(1) shall lead to the unwinding of a netting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The moment of entry of a transfer order into a system shall be defined by the rules of that system. If there are conditions laid down in the national law governing the system as to the moment of entry, the rules of that system must be in accordance with such conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of interoperable systems, each system determines in its own rules the moment of entry into its system, in such a way as to ensure, to the extent possible, that the rules of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated in this regard. Unless expressly provided for by the rules of all the systems that are party to the interoperable systems, one system&#x27;s rules on the moment of entry shall not be affected by any rules of the other systems with which it is interoperable.&lt;/li&gt;
