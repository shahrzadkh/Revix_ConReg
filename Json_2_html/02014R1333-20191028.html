&lt;li&gt;The actual reporting population shall consist of the euro area resident MFIs from the reference reporting population that are identified by the Governing Council as reporting agents pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, or MFIs identified as reporting agents pursuant to paragraph 4 on the basis of the criteria stated therein, and that are notified of their reporting obligations pursuant to paragraph 5 (hereinafter reporting agents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon the date of entry into force of this Regulation, the Governing Council may decide that an MFI is a reporting agent if the MFI has total main balance sheet assets larger than 0,35 % of the total main balance sheet assets of all the euro area MFIs on the basis of the most recent data available to the ECB, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data with reference to the end of December of the calendar year preceding notification pursuant to paragraph 5; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the data under (a) are not available, data with reference to the end of December of the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purpose of this decision the calculation of the total main balance sheet assets of the respective MFI shall exclude branches outside the host country of the respective MFI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 1 January 2017 the Governing Council may decide to classify any other MFI as a reporting agent on the basis of the size of its total main balance sheet assets in comparison to the total main balance sheet assets of all euro area MFIs, the significance of the MFI&#x27;s activities in the trading of money market instruments and its relevance to the stability and functioning of the financial system in the euro area and/or individual Member States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 1 January 2017 the Governing Council may also decide that, for each euro area Member State, at least three MFIs shall be identified as reporting agents. Accordingly, if on the basis of Governing Council decisions taken pursuant to paragraph 2 or paragraph 3, fewer than three MFIs are selected in a particular euro area Member State, the actual reporting population will also comprise other MFIs from that euro area Member State which are deemed representative by the relevant NCB (hereinafter representative reporting agents), so that at minimum three reporting agents are identified as reporting agents for that euro area Member State.&lt;br&gt;The representative reporting agents shall be selected from the largest credit institutions resident in the euro area Member State concerned, based on the total main balance sheet assets of the institutions, unless alternative criteria are suggested by the NCBs and agreed in writing by the ECB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ECB or the relevant NCB shall notify the MFIs concerned of any Governing Council decision taken pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 or 4 and of their obligations under this Regulation. The notification shall be sent in writing at least four months before the start of first reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding any Governing Council decisions taken pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 or 4, NCBs may also collect money market statistics from MFIs resident in their Member State which are not reporting agents pursuant to paragraph 2, 3 or 4, based on their national statistical reporting requirements (hereinafter additional reporting agents). If an NCB identifies additional reporting agents in this manner it shall promptly notify them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of the regular production of money market statistics, the reporting agents shall report to the NCB of the Member State where they are resident on a consolidated basis, including for all their Union and EFTA branches, daily statistical information relating to money market instruments. The required statistical information is specified in Annexes I, II and III. The reporting agents shall report the required statistical information in accordance with the minimum standards for transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts, revisions and data integrity set out in Annex IV. The NCB shall transmit the statistical information it receives from the reporting agents to the ECB in accordance with Article 4(2) of this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NCBs shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by the reporting agents relating to money market instruments. These reporting arrangements shall ensure the provision of the statistical information required and allow accurate checking of the fulfilment of the minimum standards set out in Annex IV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding the reporting requirement specified in paragraph 1, an NCB may decide that reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(2), (3) and (4) resident in the Member State of the NCB shall report the statistical information specified in Annexes I, II, III to the ECB. The NCB shall inform the ECB and the reporting agents accordingly, whereupon the ECB shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by the reporting agents and take over the task of collecting the required data directly from the reporting agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an NCB has selected additional reporting agents and notified them as referred to in Article 2(6) they shall report daily statistical information relating to money market instruments to the NCB. The NCB shall transmit the statistical information they receive from the additional reporting agents to the ECB upon the ECB&#x27;s request in accordance with Article 4(2) of this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NCBs shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by additional reporting agents in accordance with their national statistical reporting requirements. The NCBs shall ensure that the national reporting arrangements require additional reporting agents to comply with requirements that are equivalent to Articles 6 to 8, 10(3), 11 and 12 of this Regulation. The NCBs shall ensure that these reporting arrangements provide the statistical information required and allow accurate checking of the fulfilment of the minimum standards set out in in Annex IV.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;NCBs shall decide by when they need to receive data from reporting agents in order to meet their reporting deadlines as specified in paragraph 2 and shall inform the reporting agents accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a deadline referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 falls on a TARGET2 closing day, the deadline shall be extended to the following TARGET2 operating day, as announced on the ECB&#x27;s website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In assessing whether a reporting agent has met the requirements under this Article, the infringement of either of the minimum standards for transmission set out in paragraph 1 (i) to (ii) of Annex IV shall constitute a case of non-compliance of the same type of reporting requirement for the purposes of establishing non-compliance in the ECB&#x27;s statistical non-compliance framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Timeliness</td><td>Article 4</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;div class=&quot;crrArticle&quot;&gt;Where reporting agents have been selected pursuant to Article 2(3) or (4), an NCB may decide that the reporting agents may transmit daily money market statistics to the NCB once a week before 1 p.m. (CET) on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the end of the week to which the data relate if for operational reasons they cannot meet the daily reporting frequency requirement. The ECB may impose conditions on the application of the derogation by NCBs.&lt;/div&gt;</td><td>Derogation</td><td>Article 5</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the event of a merger, division, spin off, or any other reorganisation that might affect the fulfilment of its statistical obligations, the reporting agent concerned shall inform the ECB and the relevant NCB, once the intention to implement such an operation has become public and within a reasonable time before it takes effect, of the procedures that are planned to fulfil the statistical reporting requirements set out in this Regulation. The reporting agent shall also notify the ECB and the relevant NCB within 14 days of the completion of such an operation.&lt;/li&gt;
