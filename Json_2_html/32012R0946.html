&lt;li&gt;Upon completion of his/her investigations and before submitting the file to ESMA’s Board of Supervisors pursuant to Article 3(1), the investigating officer shall inform the person subject to investigation in writing of his/her findings and shall provide it with the opportunity to make written submissions pursuant to paragraph 3. That statement of findings shall set out the facts liable to constitute one or more of the infringements listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, including any aggravating or mitigating factors of these infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The statement of findings shall set a reasonable time limit within which the person subject to investigation may make its written submissions. The investigating officer shall not be obliged to take into account written submissions received after that time limit has expired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its written submissions, the person subject to investigation may set out all the facts known to it which are relevant to its defence. It shall attach any relevant documents as proof of the facts set out. It may propose that the investigating officer hear other persons who may corroborate the facts set out in the submissions of the person subject to investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investigating officer may also invite a person subject to investigation to which a statement of findings has been addressed to attend an oral hearing. The persons subject to investigation may be assisted by their lawyers or other qualified persons admitted by the investigating officer. Oral hearings shall not be held in public.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete file to be submitted by the investigating officer to ESMA’s Board of Supervisors shall include at least the following documents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;copy of the statement of findings that he addressed to the credit rating agency,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;copy of the written submissions by the credit rating agency,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;minutes of any oral hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where ESMA’s Board of Supervisors considers that the file submitted by the investigating officer is not complete, it shall send back the file to the investigating officer with reasoned request for additional documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where ESMA’s Board of Supervisors considers, on the basis of a complete file, that the facts, described in the statement of findings, appear not to disclose any possible infringement of the ones listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, it shall take a decision to close the case and it shall notify such a decision to the persons subject to investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where ESMA’s Board of Supervisors does not agree with the findings of the investigating officer it shall submit a new statement of findings to the persons subject to investigation.&lt;br&gt;The statement of findings shall set a reasonable time limit within which the persons subject to investigation may make written submissions. ESMA’s Board of Supervisors shall not be obliged to take into account written submissions received after the expiry of that time limit for adopting a decision on the existence of an infringement and on supervisory measures and the imposition of a fine in accordance with Articles 24 and 36a of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.&lt;br&gt;ESMA’s Board of Supervisors may also invite the persons subject to investigation to which a statement of findings has been addressed to attend an oral hearing. The persons subject to investigation may be assisted by their lawyers or other qualified persons admitted by ESMA’s Board of Supervisors. Oral hearings shall not be held in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where ESMA’s Board of Supervisors agrees with the findings of the investigating officer it shall inform the persons subject to investigation accordingly. Such communication shall set a reasonable time limit within which the person subject to investigation may make written submissions. ESMA’s Board of Supervisors shall not be obliged to take into account written submissions received after the expiry of that time limit for adopting a decision on the existence of an infringement and on supervisory measures and the imposition of a fine in accordance with Articles 24 and 36a of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.&lt;br&gt;ESMA’s Board of Supervisors may also invite the persons subject to investigation to which a statement of findings has been addressed to attend an oral hearing. The persons subject to investigation may be assisted by their lawyers or other qualified persons admitted by ESMA’s Board of Supervisors. Oral hearings shall not be held in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ESMA’s Board of Supervisors has decided that one or more of the infringements listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 has been committed by a person subject to investigation and has adopted a decision imposing a fine in accordance with Article 36a, it shall notify immediately such decision to the person subject to investigation.&lt;/li&gt;

The statement of findings shall set a time limit within which the person concerned may make written submissions. The Board of Supervisor shall not be obliged to take into account written submissions received after the expiry of that time limit for deciding on the periodic penalty payment.&lt;br&gt;Once the credit rating agency or person concerned has complied with the relevant decision referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d) of Article 36b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, a periodic penalty payment can no longer be imposed.&lt;br&gt;ESMA’s Board of Supervisors may also invite the person subject to the proceedings to attend an oral hearing.

&lt;li&gt;If so requested, ESMA shall grant access to the file to the parties to whom the investigating officer or the Board of Supervisors has sent a statement of findings. Access shall be granted following the notification of any statement of findings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESMA’s powers to impose fines on credit rating agencies shall be subject to the following limitation periods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;three years in the case of infringements for which the minimum basic amount of the fine foreseen in Article 36a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 is EUR 50000 or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five years in the case of all other infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The periods of time referred to in paragraph 1 shall begin to run on the day following that on which the infringement is committed. However, in the case of continuing or repeated infringements, those periods of time shall begin to run on the day on which the infringement ceases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any action taken by ESMA for the purpose of the investigating or proceedings in respect of an infringement of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 shall interrupt the limitation period for the imposition of fines. That limitation period shall be interrupted with effect from the date on which the action is notified to the credit rating agency or the person subject to the investigating or proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each interruption shall cause the limitation period to start running afresh. However, the limitation period shall expire at the latest on the day on which a period equal to twice the limitation period has elapsed without ESMA having imposed a fine. That period shall be extended by the time during which limitation is suspended pursuant to paragraph 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limitation period for imposing fines shall be suspended for as long as the decision of ESMA is the subject of proceedings pending before the Board of Appeal, in accordance with Article 58 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilOJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84., and before the Court of Justice of the European Union, in accordance with Article 36e of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.&lt;/li&gt;
