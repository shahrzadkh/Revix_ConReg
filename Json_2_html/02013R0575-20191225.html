The six-month period shall be deemed the conciliation period within the meaning of that Regulation. EBA shall take its decision within one month. The matter shall not be referred to EBA after the end of the six-month period or after a joint decision has been reached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the absence of a joint decision between the competent authorities within six months, the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the subsidiary on an individual basis shall make its own decision on point (b) of paragraph 1.&lt;br&gt;The decision shall be set out in a document containing the fully reasoned decision and shall take into account the views and reservations of the other competent authorities expressed during the six-month period.&lt;br&gt;The decision shall be provided to the consolidating supervisor that informs the EU parent institution, the EU parent financial holding company or the EU parent mixed financial holding company.&lt;br&gt;If, at the end of the six-month period, the consolidating supervisor has referred the matter to EBA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the subsidiary on an individual basis shall defer its decision on point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article and await any decision that EBA may take in accordance with Article 19(3) of that Regulation on its decision, and shall take its decision in conformity with the decision of EBA.

In the event of disagreement during the six-month period, the consolidating supervisor shall consult EBA at the request of any of the other competent authorities concerned. The consolidating supervisor may consult EBA on its own initiative.&lt;br&gt;The joint decision may also impose constraints on the location and ownership of liquid assets and require minimum amounts of liquid assets to be held by institutions that are exempt from the application of Part Six.&lt;br&gt;The joint decision shall be set out in a document containing the fully reasoned decision which shall be submitted to the parent institution of the liquidity subgroup by the consolidating supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the absence of a joint decision within six months, each competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis shall take its own decision.&lt;br&gt;However, any competent authority may during the six-month period refer to EBA the question whether the conditions in points (a) to (d) of Article 8(1) are met. In that case, EBA may carry out its non-binding mediation in accordance with Article 31(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and all the competent authorities involved shall defer their decisions pending the conclusion of the non-binding mediation. Where, during the mediation, no agreement has been reached by the competent authorities within three months, each competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis shall take its own decision taking into account the proportionality of benefits and risks at the level of the Member State of the parent institution and the proportionality of benefits and risks at the level of the Member State of the subsidiary.

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, institutions may include interim or year-end profits in Common Equity Tier 1 capital before the institution has taken a formal decision confirming the final profit or loss of the institution for the year only with the prior permission of the competent authority. The competent authority shall grant permission where the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those profits have been verified by persons independent of the institution that are responsible for the auditing of the accounts of that institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that any foreseeable charge or dividend has been deducted from the amount of those profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;A verification of the interim or year-end profits of the institution shall provide an adequate level of assurance that those profits have been evaluated in accordance with the principles set out in the applicable accounting framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall evaluate whether issuances of capital instruments meet the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29. Institutions shall classify issuances of capital instruments as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments only after permission is granted by the competent authorities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, institutions may classify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments subsequent issuances of a form of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments for which they have already received that permission, provided that both of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the provisions governing those subsequent issuances are substantially the same as the provisions governing those issuances for which the institutions have already received permission;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;Competent authorities shall consult EBA before granting permission for new forms of capital instruments to be classified as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. Competent authorities shall have due regard to EBA&#x27;s opinion and, where they decide to deviate from it, shall write to EBA within three months from the date of receipt of EBA&#x27;s opinion setting out the rationale for deviating from the relevant opinion. This subparagraph does not apply to the capital instruments referred to in Article 31.&lt;br&gt;On the basis of information collected from competent authorities, EBA shall establish, maintain and publish a list of all forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, EBA may collect any information in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that it considers necessary to establish compliance with the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29 of this Regulation and for the purpose of maintaining and updating the list referred to in this subparagraph.&lt;br&gt;Following the review process set out in Article 80 and where there is sufficient evidence that the relevant capital instruments do not meet or have ceased to meet the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29, EBA may decide not to add those instruments to the list referred to in the fourth subparagraph or remove them from that list, as the case may be. EBA shall make an announcement to that effect that shall also refer to the relevant competent authority&#x27;s position on the matter. This subparagraph does not apply to the capital instruments referred to in Article 31.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the instruments are issued directly by the institution with the prior approval of the owners of the institution or, where permitted under applicable national law, the management body of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments are fully paid up and the acquisition of ownership of those instruments is not funded directly or indirectly by the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments meet all the following conditions as regards their classification:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they qualify as capital within the meaning of Article 22 of Directive 86/635/EEC;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are classified as equity within the meaning of the applicable accounting framework;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are classified as equity capital for the purposes of determining balance sheet insolvency, where applicable under national insolvency law;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments are clearly and separately disclosed on the balance sheet in the financial statements of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments are perpetual;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the principal amount of the instruments may not be reduced or repaid, except in either of the following cases:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the liquidation of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discretionary repurchases of the instruments or other discretionary means of reducing capital, where the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority in accordance with Article 77;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the provisions governing the instruments do not indicate expressly or implicitly that the principal amount of the instruments would or might be reduced or repaid other than in the liquidation of the institution, and the institution does not otherwise provide such an indication prior to or at issuance of the instruments, except in the case of instruments referred to in Article 27 where the refusal by the institution to redeem such instruments is prohibited under applicable national law;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments meet the following conditions as regards distributions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no preferential distribution treatment regarding the order of distribution payments, including in relation to other Common Equity Tier 1 instruments, and the terms governing the instruments do not provide preferential rights to payment of distributions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributions to holders of the instruments may be paid only out of distributable items;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the conditions governing the instruments do not include a cap or other restriction on the maximum level of distributions, except in the case of the instruments referred to in Article 27;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the level of distributions is not determined on the basis of the amount for which the instruments were purchased at issuance, except in the case of the instruments referred to in Article 27;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the conditions governing the instruments do not include any obligation for the institution to make distributions to their holders and the institution is not otherwise subject to such an obligation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-payment of distributions does not constitute an event of default of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cancellation of distributions imposes no restrictions on the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compared to all the capital instruments issued by the institution, the instruments absorb the first and proportionately greatest share of losses as they occur, and each instrument absorbs losses to the same degree as all other Common Equity Tier 1 instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments rank below all other claims in the event of insolvency or liquidation of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments entitle their owners to a claim on the residual assets of the institution, which, in the event of its liquidation and after the payment of all senior claims, is proportionate to the amount of such instruments issued and is not fixed or subject to a cap, except in the case of the capital instruments referred to in Article 27;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments are neither secured nor subject to a guarantee that enhances the seniority of the claim by any of the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution or its subsidiaries;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the parent undertaking of the institution or its subsidiaries;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the mixed activity holding company or its subsidiaries;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the instruments are not subject to any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, that enhances the seniority of claims under the instruments in insolvency or liquidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The condition set out in point (j) of the first subparagraph shall be deemed to be met, notwithstanding the instruments are included in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 by virtue of Article 484(3), provided that they rank pari passu.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, only the part of a capital instrument that is fully paid up shall be eligible to qualify as a Common Equity Tier 1 instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conditions laid down in point (i) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding a write down on a permanent basis of the principal amount of Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments.&lt;br&gt;The condition laid down in point (f) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding the reduction of the principal amount of the capital instrument within a resolution procedure or as a consequence of a write down of capital instruments required by the resolution authority responsible for the institution.&lt;br&gt;The condition laid down in point (g) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding the provisions governing the capital instrument indicating expressly or implicitly that the principal amount of the instrument would or might be reduced within a resolution procedure or as a consequence of a write down of capital instruments required by the resolution authority responsible for the institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The condition laid down in point (h)(iii) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding the instrument paying a dividend multiple, provided that such a dividend multiple does not result in a distribution that causes a disproportionate drag on own funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition set out in point (h)(v) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be considered to be met notwithstanding a subsidiary being subject to a profit and loss transfer agreement with its parent undertaking, according to which the subsidiary is obliged to transfer, following the preparation of its annual financial statements, its annual result to the parent undertaking, where all the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the parent undertaking owns 90 % or more of the voting rights and capital of the subsidiary;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the parent undertaking and the subsidiary are located in the same Member State;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the agreement was concluded for legitimate taxation purposes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in preparing the annual financial statement, the subsidiary has discretion to decrease the amount of distributions by allocating a part or all of its profits to its own reserves or funds for general banking risk before making any payment to its parent undertaking;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the parent undertaking is obliged under the agreement to fully compensate the subsidiary for all losses of the subsidiary;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the agreement is subject to a notice period according to which the agreement can be terminated only by the end of an accounting year, with such termination taking effect no earlier than the beginning of the following accounting year, leaving the parent undertaking&#x27;s obligation to fully compensate the subsidiary for all losses incurred during the current accounting year unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where an institution has entered into a profit and loss transfer agreement, it shall notify the competent authority without delay and provide the competent authority with a copy of the agreement. The institution shall also notify the competent authority without delay of any changes to the profit and loss transfer agreement and the termination thereof. An institution shall not enter into more than one profit and loss transfer agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of point (h)(i) of paragraph 1, differentiated distributions shall only reflect differentiated voting rights. In this respect, higher distributions shall only apply to Common Equity Tier 1 instruments with fewer or no voting rights.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a modification of the terms and conditions of a debt obligation, where such modification would not have been granted had the obligor not experienced difficulties in meeting its financial commitments;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the following situations shall be considered forbearance measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new contract terms are more favourable to the obligor than the previous contract terms, where the obligor is experiencing or is likely to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new contract terms are more favourable to the obligor than contract terms offered by the same institution to obligors with a similar risk profile at that time, where the obligor is experiencing or is likely to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exposure under the initial contract terms was classified as non-performing before the modification to the contract terms or would have been classified as non-performing in the absence of modification to the contract terms;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the measure results in a total or partial cancellation of the debt obligation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution approves the exercise of clauses that enable the obligor to modify the terms of the contract and the exposure was classified as non-performing before the exercise of those clauses, or would be classified as non-performing were those clauses not exercised;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at or close to the time of the granting of debt, the obligor made payments of principal or interest on another debt obligation with the same institution, which was classified as a non-performing exposure or would have been classified as non-performing in the absence of those payments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the modification to the contract terms involves repayments made by taking possession of collateral, where such modification constitutes a concession.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following circumstances are indicators that forbearance measures may have been adopted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the initial contract was past due by more than 30 days at least once during the three months prior to its modification or would be more than 30 days past due without modification;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at or close to the time of concluding the credit agreement, the obligor made payments of principal or interest on another debt obligation with the same institution that was past due by 30 days at least once during the three months prior to the granting of new debt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution approves the exercise of clauses that enable the obligor to change the terms of the contract, and the exposure is 30 days past due or would be 30 days past due were those clauses not exercised.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of this Article, the difficulties experienced by an obligor in meeting its financial commitments shall be assessed at obligor level, taking into account all the legal entities in the obligor&#x27;s group which are included in the accounting consolidation of the group, and natural persons who control that group.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the instruments are directly issued by an institution and fully paid up;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments are not owned by any of the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution or its subsidiaries;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an undertaking in which the institution has a participation in the form of ownership, direct or by way of control, of 20 % or more of the voting rights or capital of that undertaking;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the acquisition of ownership of the instruments is not funded directly or indirectly by the institution;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the instruments are not subject to any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, that enhances the seniority of the claim under the instruments in insolvency or liquidation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments are perpetual and the provisions governing them include no incentive for the institution to redeem them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the instruments include one or more early redemption options including call options, the options are exercisable at the sole discretion of the issuer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments may be called, redeemed or repurchased only where the conditions laid down in Article 77 are met, and not before five years after the date of issuance except where the conditions laid down in Article 78(4) are met;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the provisions governing the instruments do not indicate explicitly or implicitly that the instruments would be called, redeemed or repurchased, as applicable, by the institution other than in the case of the insolvency or liquidation of the institution and the institution does not otherwise provide such an indication;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution does not indicate explicitly or implicitly that the competent authority would consent to a request to call, redeem or repurchase the instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributions under the instruments meet the following conditions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are paid out of distributable items;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the level of distributions made on the instruments will not be amended on the basis of the credit standing of the institution or its parent undertaking;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;cancellation of distributions does not constitute an event of default of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cancellation of distributions imposes no restrictions on the institution;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the instruments are not subject to set-off or netting arrangements that would undermine their capacity to absorb losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The condition set out in point (d) of the first subparagraph shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding the fact that the instruments are included in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 by virtue of Article 484(3), provided that they rank pari passu.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, only the part of a capital instrument that is fully paid up shall be eligible to qualify as an Additional Tier 1 instrument.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a requirement for distributions on the instruments to be made in the event of a distribution being made on an instrument issued by the institution that ranks to the same degree as, or more junior than, an Additional Tier 1 instrument, including a Common Equity Tier 1 instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a requirement for the payment of distributions on Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments to be cancelled in the event that distributions are not made on those Additional Tier 1 instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an obligation to substitute the payment of interest or dividend by a payment in any other form. The institution shall not otherwise be subject to such an obligation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trigger event occurs when the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the institution referred to in point (a) of Article 92(1) falls below either of the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5,125 %;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a level higher than 5,125 %, where determined by the institution and specified in the provisions governing the instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions may specify in the provisions governing the instrument one or more trigger events in addition to that referred to in point (a);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rate of such conversion and a limit on the permitted amount of conversion;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a range within which the instruments will convert into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the provisions governing the instruments require their principal amount to be written down upon the occurrence of a trigger event, the write down shall reduce all the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the claim of the holder of the instrument in the insolvency or liquidation of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount required to be paid in the event of the call or redemption of the instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the distributions made on the instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the Additional Tier 1 instruments have been issued by a subsidiary undertaking established in a third country, the 5,125 % or higher trigger referred to in point (a) shall be calculated in accordance with the national law of that third country or contractual provisions governing the instruments, provided that the competent authority, after consulting EBA, is satisfied that those provisions are at least equivalent to the requirements set out in this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down or conversion of an Additional Tier 1 instrument shall, under the applicable accounting framework, generate items that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of Additional Tier 1 instruments recognised in Additional Tier 1 items is limited to the minimum amount of Common Equity Tier 1 items that would be generated if the principal amount of the Additional Tier 1 instruments were fully written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregate amount of Additional Tier 1 instruments that is required to be written down or converted upon the occurrence of a trigger event shall be no less than the lower of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the own funds and eligible liabilities of the institution would, following the action referred to in Article 77(1) of this Regulation, exceed the requirements laid down in this Regulation and in Directives 2013/36/EU and 2014/59/EU by a margin that the competent authority considers necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where an institution provides sufficient safeguards as to its capacity to operate with own funds above the amounts required in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU, the competent authority may grant that institution a general prior permission to take any of the actions set out in Article 77(1) of this Regulation, subject to criteria that ensure that any such future action will be in accordance with the conditions set out in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph. That general prior permission shall be granted only for a specified period, which shall not exceed one year, after which it may be renewed. The general prior permission shall be granted for a certain predetermined amount, which shall be set by the competent authority. In the case of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments, that predetermined amount shall not exceed 3 % of the relevant issue and shall not exceed 10 % of the amount by which Common Equity Tier 1 capital exceeds the sum of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirements laid down in this Regulation, in Directives 2013/36/EU and 2014/59/EU by a margin that the competent authority considers necessary.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions&#x27; trading desks shall at all times meet all the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each trading desk shall have a clear and distinctive business strategy and a risk management structure that is adequate for its business strategy;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each trading desk shall have a clear organisational structure; positions in a given trading desk shall be managed by designated dealers within the institution; each dealer shall have dedicated functions in the trading desk; each dealer shall be assigned to one trading desk only;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;position limits shall be set within each trading desk according to the business strategy of that trading desk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reports on the activities, profitability, risk management and regulatory requirements at the trading desk level shall be produced at least on a weekly basis and communicated to the management body on a regular basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each trading desk shall have a clear annual business plan including a well-defined remuneration policy on the basis of sound criteria used for performance measurement;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the manner in which they comply with paragraph 2. Competent authorities may require an institution to change the structure or organisation of its trading desks to comply with this Article.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All trading book positions shall be subject to the standards for prudent valuation specified in this Article. Institutions shall in particular ensure that the prudent valuation of their trading book positions achieves an appropriate degree of certainty having regard to the dynamic nature of trading book positions, the demands of prudential soundness and the mode of operation and purpose of capital requirements in respect of trading book positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall establish and maintain systems and controls sufficient to provide prudent and reliable valuation estimates. Those systems and controls shall include at least the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;documented policies and procedures for the process of valuation, including clearly defined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the determination of the valuation, sources of market information and review of their appropriateness, guidelines for the use of unobservable inputs reflecting the institution&#x27;s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing of closing prices, procedures for adjusting valuations, month end and ad-hoc verification procedures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reporting lines for the department accountable for the valuation process that are clear and independent of the front office, which shall ultimately be to the management body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall revalue trading book positions at least daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall mark their positions to market whenever possible, including when applying trading book capital treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When marking to market, an institution shall use the more prudent side of bid and offer unless the institution can close out at mid market. Where institutions make use of this derogation, they shall every six months inform their competent authorities of the positions concerned and furnish evidence that they can close out at mid-market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where marking to market is not possible, institutions shall conservatively mark to model their positions and portfolios, including when calculating own funds requirements for positions in the trading book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall comply with the following requirements when marking to model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;senior management shall be aware of the elements of the trading book or of other fair-valued positions which are subject to mark to model and shall understand the materiality of the uncertainty thereby created in the reporting of the risk/performance of the business;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall source market inputs, where possible, in line with market prices, and shall assess the appropriateness of the market inputs of the particular position being valued and the parameters of the model on a frequent basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where available, institutions shall use valuation methodologies which are accepted market practice for particular financial instruments or commodities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the model is developed by the institution itself, it shall be based on appropriate assumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall have in place formal change control procedures and shall hold a secure copy of the model and use it periodically to check valuations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk management shall be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to reflect those in the valuation output; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions&#x27; models shall be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of their performance, which shall include assessing the continued appropriateness of assumptions, analysis of profit and loss versus risk factors, and comparison of actual close out values to model outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of point (d), the model shall be developed or approved independently of the trading desk and shall be independently tested, including validation of the mathematics, assumptions and software implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall perform independent price verification in addition to daily marking to market or marking to model. Verification of market prices and model inputs shall be performed by a person or unit independent from persons or units that benefit from the trading book, at least monthly, or more frequently depending on the nature of the market or trading activity. Where independent pricing sources are not available or pricing sources are more subjective, prudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall establish and maintain procedures for considering valuation adjustments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall formally consider the following valuation adjustments: unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, market price uncertainty, early termination, investing and funding costs, future administrative costs and, where relevant, model risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall establish and maintain procedures for calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of any less liquid positions, which can in particular arise from market events or institution-related situations such as concentrated positions and/or positions for which the originally intended holding period has been exceeded. Institutions shall, where necessary, make such adjustments in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial reporting purposes and shall design such adjustments to reflect the illiquidity of the position. Under those procedures, institutions shall consider several factors when determining whether a valuation adjustment is necessary for less liquid positions. Those factors include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of time it would take to hedge out the position or the risks within the position;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the volatility and average of bid/offer spreads;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the availability of market quotes (number and identity of market makers) and the volatility and average of trading volumes including trading volumes during periods of market stress;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market concentrations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ageing of positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent to which valuation relies on marking-to-model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the impact of other model risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using third party valuations or marking to model, institutions shall consider whether to apply a valuation adjustment. In addition, institutions shall consider the need to establish adjustments for less liquid positions and on an ongoing basis review their continued suitability. Institutions shall also explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments relating to the uncertainty of parameter inputs used by models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With regard to complex products, including securitisation exposures and n-th-to-default credit derivatives, institutions shall explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect the model risk associated with using a possibly incorrect valuation methodology and the model risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) calibration parameters in the valuation model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which the requirements of Article 105 shall be applied for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 July 2013.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The requirements of paragraph 1 apply without prejudice to the requirements applicable to the hedged position in the non-trading book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, when an institution hedges a non-trading book credit risk exposure or counterparty risk exposure using a credit derivative booked in its trading book using an internal hedge, the non-trading book exposure or counterparty risk exposure shall not be deemed to be hedged for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts unless the institution purchases from an eligible third party protection provider a corresponding credit derivative meeting the requirements for unfunded credit protection in the non-trading book. Without prejudice to point (h) of Article 299(2), where such third party protection is purchased and recognised as a hedge of a non-trading book exposure for the purposes of calculating capital requirements, neither the internal nor external credit derivative hedge shall be included in the trading book for the purposes of calculating capital requirements.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, risk weights shall be applied to all exposures, unless deducted from own funds, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2. The application of risk weights shall be based on the exposure class to which the exposure is assigned and, to the extent specified in Section 2, its credit quality. Credit quality may be determined by reference to the credit assessments of ECAIs or the credit assessments of export credit agencies in accordance with Section 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of applying a risk weight, as referred to in paragraph 1, the exposure value shall be multiplied by the risk weight specified or determined in accordance with Section 2.&lt;/li&gt;

Competent authorities are empowered to grant approval if the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counterparty is an institution, a financial institution or an ancillary services undertaking subject to appropriate prudential requirements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counterparty is included in the same consolidation as the institution on a full basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counterparty is subject to the same risk evaluation, measurement and control procedures as the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counterparty is established in the same Member State as the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities from the counterparty to the institution.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of exposures giving rise to Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 items, institutions may, subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, not apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article to exposures to counterparties with which the institution has entered into an institutional protection scheme that is a contractual or statutory liability arrangement which protects those institutions and in particular ensures their liquidity and solvency to avoid bankruptcy where necessary. Competent authorities are empowered to grant permission if the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the requirements set out in points (a), (d) and (e) of paragraph 6 are met;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the institutional protection scheme disposes of suitable and uniformly stipulated systems for the monitoring and classification of risk, which gives a complete overview of the risk situations of all the individual members and the institutional protection scheme as a whole, with corresponding possibilities to take influence; those systems shall suitably monitor defaulted exposures in accordance with Article 178(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institutional protection scheme conducts its own risk review which is communicated to the individual members;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institutional protection scheme draws up and publishes on an annual basis, a consolidated report comprising the balance sheet, the profit-and-loss account, the situation report and the risk report, concerning the institutional protection scheme as a whole, or a report comprising the aggregated balance sheet, the aggregated profit-and-loss account, the situation report and the risk report, concerning the institutional protection scheme as a whole;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;members of the institutional protection scheme are obliged to give advance notice of at least 24 months if they wish to end the institutional protection scheme;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the multiple use of elements eligible for the calculation of own funds (hereinafter referred to as multiple gearing) as well as any inappropriate creation of own funds between the members of the institutional protection scheme shall be eliminated;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the adequacy of the systems referred to in points (c) and (d) is approved and monitored at regular intervals by the relevant competent authorities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CIU is managed by a company that is subject to supervision in a Member State or, in the case of third country CIU, where the following conditions are met:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CIU is managed by a company which is subject to supervision that is considered equivalent to that laid down in Union law;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cooperation between competent authorities is sufficiently ensured;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CIU&#x27;s prospectus or equivalent document includes the following:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if investment limits apply, the relative limits and the methodologies to calculate them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the business of the CIU is reported on at least an annual basis to enable an assessment to be made of the assets and liabilities, income and operations over the reporting period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of point (a), the Commission may adopt, by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether a third country applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. In the absence of such a decision, until 1 January 2015, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in this paragraph to exposures in the form of units or shares of CIUs from third countries where the relevant competent authorities had approved the third country as eligible for that treatment before 1 January 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to calculate an average risk weight for its exposures in the form of units or shares in the CIUs in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter. Where an underlying exposure of the CIU is itself an exposure in the form of shares in another CIU which fulfils the criteria of paragraph 3, the institution may look through to the underlying exposures of that other CIU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may calculate an average risk weight for its exposures in the form of a unit or share in the CIU in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter subject to the assumption that the CIU first invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in the exposure classes attracting the highest capital requirement, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report, in accordance with the methods set out in paragraphs 4 and 5, a risk weight for the CIU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures subject to the condition that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures, up to a maximum of 1250 % and multiplied by the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative to obtain the risk-weighted exposure amount. The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments are the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option the exercise of which is reasonably certain. A party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment related to the residual value of a leased property and that payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions in Article 201 regarding the eligibility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising other types of guarantees provided in Articles 213 to 215, that payment obligation may be taken into account as unfunded credit protection under Chapter 4. These exposures shall be assigned to the relevant exposure class in accordance with Article 112. When the exposure is a residual value of leased assets, the risk-weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated as follows: 1/t * 100 % * residual value, where t is the greater of 1 and the nearest number of whole years of the lease remaining.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;where EBA, EIOPA and ESMA have increased the associated risk weight for a specific credit assessment of a particular ECAI, and where default rates experienced for that ECAI&#x27;s credit assessment are no longer materially and systematically higher than the benchmark, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA may restore the original credit quality step in the credit quality assessment scale for the ECAI credit assessment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competent authority shall grant permission pursuant to Article 143 for an institution to use the IRB Approach, including to use own estimates of LGD and conversion factors, only if the competent authority is satisfied that requirements laid down in this Chapter are met, in particular those laid down in Section 6, and that the systems of the institution for the management and rating of credit risk exposures are sound and implemented with integrity and, in particular, that the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the following standards are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution&#x27;s rating systems provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal ratings and default and loss estimates used in the calculation of own funds requirements and associated systems and processes play an essential role in the risk management and decision-making process, and in the credit approval, internal capital allocation and corporate governance functions of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has a credit risk control unit responsible for its rating systems that is appropriately independent and free from undue influence;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution collects and stores all relevant data to provide effective support to its credit risk measurement and management process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution documents its rating systems and the rationale for their design and validates its rating systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has validated each rating system and each internal models approach for equity exposures during an appropriate time period prior to the permission to use this rating system or internal models approach to equity exposures, has assessed during this time period whether the rating system or internal models approaches for equity exposures are suited to the range of application of the rating system or internal models approach for equity exposures, and has made necessary changes to these rating systems or internal models approaches for equity exposures following from its assessment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has calculated under the IRB Approach the own funds requirements resulting from its risk parameters estimates and is able to submit the reporting as required by Article 99;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has assigned and continues with assigning each exposure in the range of application of a rating system to a rating grade or pool of this rating system; the institution has assigned and continues with assigning each exposure in the range of application of an approach for equity exposures to this internal models approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The requirements to use an IRB Approach, including own estimates of LGD and conversion factors, apply also where an institution has implemented a rating system, or model used within a rating system, that it has purchased from a third-party vendor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the assessment methodology competent authorities shall follow in assessing the compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB Approach.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An institution applying for the use of own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that it has been estimating and employing own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors in a manner that is broadly consistent with the requirements for use of own estimates of those parameters set out in Section 6 for at least three years prior to qualification to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the institution extends the use of the IRB Approach subsequent to its initial permission, the experience of the institution shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 in respect of the additional exposures covered. If the use of rating systems is extended to exposures that are significantly different from the scope of the existing coverage, such that the existing experience cannot be reasonably assumed to be sufficient to meet the requirements of these provisions in respect of the additional exposures, then the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply separately for the additional exposures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for all other exposures, the risk weight shall be multiplied by a factor of 1,1 and shall be subject to a minimum of 5 %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where, for the purposes of point (a), the institution is unable to differentiate between private equity, exchange-traded and other equity exposures, it shall treat the exposures concerned as other equity exposures. Where those exposures, taken together with the institution&#x27;s direct exposures in that exposure class, are not material within the meaning of Article 150(2), Article 150(1) may be applied subject to the permission of the competent authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU do not meet the criteria set out in Article 132(3), or where the institution is not aware of all of the underlying exposures of the CIU or of the underlying exposures of a unit or share in a CIU which is itself an underlying exposure of the CIU, the institution shall look through to those underlying exposures and calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in accordance with the simple risk-weight approach set out in Article 155(2).&lt;br&gt;Where the institution is unable to differentiate between private equity, exchange-traded and other equity exposures, it shall treat the exposures concerned as other equity exposures. It shall assign non equity exposures to the other equity class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively to the method described in paragraph 3, institutions may calculate themselves or may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report the average risk-weighted exposure amounts based on the CIU&#x27;s underlying exposures in accordance with the approaches referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

In this formula S is expressed as total annual sales in millions of euro with EUR 5 million ≤ S ≤ EUR 50 million. Reported sales of less than EUR 5 million shall be treated as if they were equivalent to EUR 5 million. For purchased receivables the total annual sales shall be the weighted average by individual exposures of the pool.#FORMULA#&lt;br&gt;Institutions shall substitute total assets of the consolidated group for total annual sales when total annual sales are not a meaningful indicator of firm size and total assets are a more meaningful indicator than total annual sales.&lt;/li&gt;

For purchased corporate receivables that comply in addition with the conditions set out in Article 154(5), and where it would be unduly burdensome for an institution to use the risk quantification standards for corporate exposures as set out in Section 6 for these receivables, the risk quantification standards for retail exposures as set out in Section 6 may be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For purchased corporate receivables, refundable purchase price discounts, collaterals or partial guarantees that provide first loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as a first loss protection by the purchaser of the receivables or by the beneficiary of the collateral or of the partial guarantee in accordance with Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 3 of Chapter 5. The seller providing the refundable purchase price discount and the provider of a collateral or a partial guarantee shall treat those as an exposure to a first loss position in accordance with Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 3 of Chapter 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures subject to the condition that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures, where the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk-weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative multiplied by 12,5. The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation. A 1250 % risk weight shall apply to positions in a basket for which an institution cannot determine the risk-weight under the IRB Approach.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the exposures are revolving, unsecured, and to the extent they are not drawn immediately and unconditionally, cancellable by the institution. In this context revolving exposures are defined as those where customers&#x27; outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate based on their decisions to borrow and repay, up to a limit established by the institution. Undrawn commitments may be considered as unconditionally cancellable if the terms permit the institution to cancel them to the full extent allowable under consumer protection and related legislation;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the use of the correlation of this paragraph is limited to portfolios that have exhibited low volatility of loss rates, relative to their average level of loss rates, especially within the low PD bands;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the treatment as a qualifying revolving retail exposure shall be consistent with the underlying risk characteristics of the sub-portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;By way of derogation from point (b), the requirement to be unsecured does not apply in respect of collateralised credit facilities linked to a wage account. In this case amounts recovered from the collateral shall not be taken into account in the LGD estimate.&lt;br&gt;Competent authorities shall review the relative volatility of loss rates across the qualifying revolving retail sub-portfolios, as well the aggregate qualifying revolving retail portfolio, and shall share information on the typical characteristics of qualifying revolving retail loss rates across Member States.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be eligible for the retail treatment, purchased receivables shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184 and the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has purchased the receivables from unrelated third party sellers, and its exposure to the obligor of the receivable does not include any exposures that are directly or indirectly originated by the institution itself;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purchased receivables shall be generated on an arm&#x27;s-length basis between the seller and the obligor. As such, inter-company accounts receivables and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other are ineligible;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purchasing institution has a claim on all proceeds from the purchased receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds; and&lt;/li&gt;

An institution may apply different approaches to different equity portfolios where the institution itself uses different approaches for internal risk management purposes.

Other short positions are to be treated as if they are long positions with the relevant risk weight assigned to the absolute value of each position. In the context of maturity mismatched positions, the method is that for corporate exposures as set out in Article 162(5).&lt;br&gt;Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the PD/LGD approach, risk-weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated according to the formulas in Article 153(1). If institutions do not have sufficient information to use the definition of default set out in Article 178, a scaling factor of 1,5 shall be assigned to the risk weights.&lt;br&gt;At the individual exposure level the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk-weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the exposure value multiplied by 12,5.&lt;br&gt;Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. This shall be subject to an LGD of 90 % on the exposure to the provider of the hedge. For private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios an LGD of 65 % may be used. For these purposes M shall be five years.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the corporate entity has a credit assessment by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates under Chapter 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the corporate entity, in the case of institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach, does not have a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI and is internally rated as having a PD equivalent to that associated with the credit assessments of ECAIs determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates under Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions using own LGD estimates may recognise unfunded credit protection by adjusting PDs subject to Article 161(3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For dilution risk of purchased corporate receivables, PD shall be set equal to the EL estimate of the institution for dilution risk. An institution that has received permission from the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own LGD estimates for corporate exposures that can decompose its EL estimates for dilution risk of purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner that the competent authority considers to be reliable, may use the PD estimate that results from this decomposition.

&lt;li&gt;for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least five days. The notional amount of each transaction shall be used for weighting the maturity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution that has received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own PD estimates for purchased corporate receivables, for drawn amounts M shall equal the purchased receivables exposure weighted average maturity, where M shall be at least 90 days. This same value of M shall also be used for undrawn amounts under a committed purchase facility provided that the facility contains effective covenants, early amortisation triggers, or other features that protect the purchasing institution against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility&#x27;s term. Absent such effective protections, M for undrawn amounts shall be calculated as the sum of the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement and the remaining maturity of the purchase facility, where M shall be at least 90 days;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for any instrument other than those referred to in this paragraph or when an institution is not in a position to calculate M as set out in point (a), M shall be the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, where M shall be at least one year;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of rating systems for exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks shall comply with the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a rating system shall take into account obligor and transaction risk characteristics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a rating system shall have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default. The obligor rating scale shall have a minimum of 7 grades for non-defaulted obligors and one for defaulted obligors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall document the relationship between obligor grades in terms of the level of default risk each grade implies and the criteria used to distinguish that level of default risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions with portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk shall have enough obligor grades within that range to avoid undue concentrations of obligors in a particular grade. Significant concentrations within a single grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the obligor grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band and that the default risk posed by all obligors in the grade falls within that band;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be permitted by the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs for own funds requirement calculation, a rating system shall incorporate a distinct facility rating scale which exclusively reflects LGD related transaction characteristics. The facility grade definition shall include both a description of how exposures are assigned to the grade and of the criteria used to distinguish the level of risk across grades;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significant concentrations within a single facility grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the facility grade covers a reasonably narrow LGD band, respectively, and that the risk posed by all exposures in the grade falls within that band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures are exempt from the requirement to have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default for these exposures. These institutions shall have for these exposures at least four grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one grade for defaulted obligors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of rating systems for retail exposures shall comply with the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rating systems shall reflect both obligor and transaction risk, and shall capture all relevant obligor and transaction characteristics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the level of risk differentiation shall ensure that the number of exposures in a given grade or pool is sufficient to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics at the grade or pool level. The distribution of exposures and obligors across grades or pools shall be such as to avoid excessive concentrations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools shall provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and shall allow for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at grade or pool level. For purchased receivables the grouping shall reflect the seller&#x27;s underwriting practices and the heterogeneity of its customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall consider the following risk drivers when assigning exposures to grades or pools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obligor risk characteristics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transaction risk characteristics, including product or collateral types or both. Institutions shall explicitly address cases where several exposures benefit from the same collateral;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delinquency, except where an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authority that delinquency is not a material driver of risk for the exposure.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An institution shall have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools within a rating system that comply with the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the grade or pool definitions and criteria shall be sufficiently detailed to allow those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign obligors or facilities posing similar risk to the same grade or pool. This consistency shall exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the documentation of the rating process shall allow third parties to understand the assignments of exposures to grades or pools, to replicate grade and pool assignments and to evaluate the appropriateness of the assignments to a grade or a pool;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the criteria shall also be consistent with the institution&#x27;s internal lending standards and its policies for handling troubled obligors and facilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools. If an institution uses an external rating as a primary factor determining an internal rating assignment, the institution shall ensure that it considers other relevant information.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3), assignment of exposures shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each obligor shall be assigned to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for those exposures for which an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors pursuant to Article 143, each exposure shall also be assigned to a facility grade as part of the credit approval process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures shall assign each of these exposures to a grade in accordance with Article 170(2);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each separate legal entity to which the institution is exposed shall be separately rated. An institution shall have appropriate policies regarding the treatment of individual obligor clients and groups of connected clients;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate exposures to the same obligor shall be assigned to the same obligor grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. However, where separate exposures are allowed to result in multiple grades for the same obligor, the following shall apply:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;country transfer risk, this being dependent on whether the exposures are denominated in local or foreign currency;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the treatment of associated guarantees to an exposure may be reflected in an adjusted assignment to an obligor grade;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consumer protection, bank secrecy or other legislation prohibit the exchange of client data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For retail exposures, each exposure shall be assigned to a grade or a pool as part of the credit approval process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For grade and pool assignments institutions shall document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides. Institutions shall document these overrides and note down the personnel responsible. Institutions shall analyse the performance of the exposures whose assignments have been overridden. This analysis shall include an assessment of the performance of exposures whose rating has been overridden by a particular person, accounting for all the responsible personnel.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3), the assignment process shall meet the following requirements of integrity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments and periodic reviews of assignments shall be completed or approved by an independent party that does not directly benefit from decisions to extend the credit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall review assignments at least annually and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. High risk obligors and problem exposures shall be subject to more frequent review. Institutions shall undertake a new assignment if material information on the obligor or exposure becomes available;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall have an effective process to obtain and update relevant information on obligor characteristics that affect PDs, and on transaction characteristics that affect LGDs or conversion factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For retail exposures, an institution shall at least annually review obligor and facility assignments and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment, or review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool, whichever applicable. An institution shall also at least annually review in a representative sample the status of individual exposures within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool, and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards for the methodologies of the competent authorities to assess the integrity of the assignment process and the regular and independent assessment of risks.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall have good predictive power and capital requirements shall not be distorted as a result of its use. The input variables shall form a reasonable and effective basis for the resulting predictions. The model shall not have material biases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have in place a process for vetting data inputs into the model, which includes an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data used to build the model shall be representative of the population of the institution&#x27;s actual obligors or exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have a regular cycle of model validation that includes monitoring of model performance and stability; review of model specification; and testing of model outputs against outcomes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall complement the statistical model by human judgement and human oversight to review model-based assignments and to ensure that the models are used appropriately. Review procedures shall aim at finding and limiting errors associated with model weaknesses. Human judgements shall take into account all relevant information not considered by the model. The institution shall document how human judgement and model results are to be combined.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The institution shall document the rationale for and analysis supporting its choice of rating criteria. An institution shall document all major changes in the risk rating process, and such documentation shall support identification of changes made to the risk rating process subsequent to the last review by the competent authorities. The organisation of rating assignment including the rating assignment process and the internal control structure shall also be documented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institutions shall document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure consistency with the definitions set out in this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the following have taken place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the obligor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days for exposures secured by residential property or SME commercial immovable property in the retail exposure class, as well as exposures to public sector entities. The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of point (m) Article 36(1) or Article 127.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying amount is material;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers to be reasonable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay shall include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or, where relevant fees. This includes, in the case of equity exposures assessed under a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has filed for the obligor&#x27;s bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor&#x27;s credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions that use external data that is not itself consistent with the definition of default laid down in paragraph 1, shall make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the institution considers that a previously defaulted exposure is such that no trigger of default continues to apply, the institution shall rate the obligor or facility as they would for a non-defaulted exposure. Where the definition of default is subsequently triggered, another default would be deemed to have occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which a competent authority shall set the threshold referred to in paragraph 2(d).&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s own estimates of the risk parameters PD, LGD, conversion factor and EL shall incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters. The institution&#x27;s estimates shall be representative of long run experience;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation periods referred to in Article 180(1)(h) and (2)(e), Article 181(1)(j) and (2), and Article 182(2) and (3) shall be taken into account. An institution&#x27;s estimates shall reflect the implications of technical advances and new data and other information, as it becomes available. Institutions shall review their estimates when new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data was generated and other relevant characteristics shall be comparable with those of the institution&#x27;s exposures and standards. The economic or market conditions that underlie the data shall be relevant to current and foreseeable conditions. The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification shall be sufficient to provide the institution with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for purchased receivables the estimates shall reflect all relevant information available to the purchasing institution regarding the quality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the purchasing institution, or by external sources. The purchasing institution shall evaluate any data relied upon which is provided by the seller;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall add to its estimates a margin of conservatism that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. Where methods and data are considered to be less satisfactory, the expected range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism shall be larger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where institutions use different estimates for the calculation of risk weights and for internal purposes, it shall be documented and be reasonable. If institutions can demonstrate to their competent authorities that for data that have been collected prior to 1 January 2007 appropriate adjustments have been made to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default laid down in Article 178 or with loss, competent authorities may permit the institutions some flexibility in the application of the required standards for data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where an institution uses data that is pooled across institutions it shall meet the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rating systems and criteria of other institutions in the pool are similar to its own;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pool is representative of the portfolio for which the pooled data is used;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pooled data is used consistently over time by the institution for its estimates;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to PD estimation to exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year default rates. PD estimates for obligors that are highly leveraged or for obligors whose assets are predominantly traded assets shall reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for purchased corporate receivables institutions may estimate the EL by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year realised default rates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an institution derives long run average estimates of PDs and LGDs for purchased corporate receivables from an estimate of EL, and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in Article 181(1)(a);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall use PD estimation techniques only with supporting analysis. Institutions shall recognise the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that an institution uses data on internal default experience for the estimation of PDs, the estimates shall be reflective of underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system. Where underwriting standards or rating systems have changed, the institution shall add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of PD;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that an institution associates or maps its internal grades to the scale used by an ECAI or similar organisations and then attributes the default rate observed for the external organisation&#x27;s grades to the institution&#x27;s grades, mappings shall be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data shall be avoided. The criteria of the external organisation underlying the data used for quantification shall be oriented to default risk only and not reflect transaction characteristics. The analysis undertaken by the institution shall include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in Article 178. The institution shall document the basis for the mapping;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that an institution uses statistical default prediction models it is allowed to estimate PDs as the simple average of default-probability estimates for individual obligors in a given grade. The institution&#x27;s use of default probability models for this purpose shall meet the standards specified in Article 174;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and this data is relevant, this longer period shall be used. This point also applies to the PD/LGD Approach to equity. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions which have not received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own estimates of LGDs or conversion factors may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For retail exposures, the following requirements shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade or pool from long run averages of one-year default rates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PD estimates may also be derived from an estimate of total losses and appropriate estimates of LGDs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall regard internal data for assigning exposures to grades or pools as the primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics. Institutions may use external data (including pooled data) or statistical models for quantification provided that the following strong links both exist:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;between the institution&#x27;s process of assigning exposures to grades or pools and the process used by the external data source; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;between the institution&#x27;s internal risk profile and the composition of the external data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an institution derives long run average estimates of PD and LGD for retail exposures from an estimate of total losses and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in point (a) of Article 181(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal or pooled data sources or a combination of the three, for their estimation of loss characteristics, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation spans a longer period for any source, and these data are relevant, this longer period shall be used. An institution need not give equal importance to historic data if more recent data is a better predictor of loss rates. Subject to the permission of the competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall identify and analyse expected changes of risk parameters over the life of credit exposures (seasoning effects).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For purchased retail receivables, institutions may use external and internal reference data. Institutions shall use all relevant data sources as points of comparison.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall estimate LGDs by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised LGDs by facility grade or pool using all observed defaults within the data sources (default weighted average);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall consider the extent of any dependence between the risk of the obligor and that of the collateral or collateral provider. Cases where there is a significant degree of dependence shall be addressed in a conservative manner;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currency mismatches between the underlying obligation and the collateral shall be treated conservatively in the institution&#x27;s assessment of LGD;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, these estimates shall not solely be based on the collateral&#x27;s estimated market value. LGD estimates shall take into account the effect of the potential inability of institutions to expeditiously gain control of their collateral and liquidate it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, institutions shall establish internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management that are generally consistent with those set out in Chapter 4, Section 3;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that an institution recognises collateral for determining the exposure value for counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 5 or 6, any amount expected to be recovered from the collateral shall not be taken into account in the LGD estimates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the specific case of exposures already in default, the institution shall use the sum of its best estimate of expected loss for each exposure given current economic circumstances and exposure status and its estimate of the increase of loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period, i.e. between date of default and final liquidation of the exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that unpaid late fees have been capitalised in the institution&#x27;s income statement, they shall be added to the institution&#x27;s measure of exposure and loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, estimates of LGD shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data is relevant, this longer period shall be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For retail exposures, institutions may do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PDs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reflect future drawings either in their conversion factors or in their LGD estimates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For purchased retail receivables use external and internal reference data to estimate LGDs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall estimate conversion factors by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised conversion factors by facility grade or pool using the default weighted average resulting from all observed defaults within the data sources;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall use conversion factor estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised conversion factors at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions&#x27; estimates of conversion factors shall reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the obligor up to and after the time a default event is triggered. The conversion factor estimate shall incorporate a larger margin of conservatism where a stronger positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of conversion factor;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in arriving at estimates of conversion factors institutions shall consider their specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. Institutions shall also consider their ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts, current outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per obligor and per grade. The institution shall be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if institutions use different estimates of conversion factors for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and internal purposes it shall be documented and be reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data is relevant, this longer period shall be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For retail exposures, institutions may reflect future drawings either in their conversion factors or in their LGD estimates.&lt;br&gt;For retail exposures, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years. By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, an institution need not give equal importance to historic data if more recent data is a better predictor of draw downs. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following requirements shall apply in relation to eligible guarantors and guarantees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall have clearly specified criteria for the types of guarantors they recognise for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for recognised guarantors the same rules as for obligors as set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173 shall apply;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the guarantee shall be evidenced in writing, non-cancellable on the part of the guarantor, in force until the obligation is satisfied in full (to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee) and legally enforceable against the guarantor in a jurisdiction where the guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a judgement. Conditional guarantees prescribing conditions under which the guarantor may not be obliged to perform may be recognised subject to permission of the competent authorities. The assignment criteria shall adequately address any potential reduction in the risk mitigation effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall have clearly specified criteria for adjusting grades, pools or LGD estimates, and, in the case of retail and eligible purchased receivables, the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools, to reflect the impact of guarantees for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts. These criteria shall comply with the requirements set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173.&lt;br&gt;The criteria shall be plausible and intuitive. They shall address the guarantor&#x27;s ability and willingness to perform under the guarantee, the likely timing of any payments from the guarantor, the degree to which the guarantor&#x27;s ability to perform under the guarantee is correlated with the obligor&#x27;s ability to repay, and the extent to which residual risk to the obligor remains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The requirements for guarantees in this Article shall apply also for single-name credit derivatives. In relation to a mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation of the credit derivative or the obligation used for determining whether a credit event has occurred, the requirements set out under Article 216(2) shall apply. For retail exposures and eligible purchased receivables, this paragraph applies to the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools.&lt;br&gt;The criteria shall address the payout structure of the credit derivative and conservatively assess the impact this has on the level and timing of recoveries. The institution shall consider the extent to which other forms of residual risk remain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not apply for guarantees provided by institutions, central governments and central banks, and corporate entities which meet the requirements laid down in Article 201(1)(g) if the institution has received permission to apply the Standardised Approach for exposures to such entities pursuant to Articles 148 and 150. In this case the requirements of Chapter 4 shall apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For retail guarantees, the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to the assignment of exposures to grades or pools, and the estimation of PD.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools for purchased receivables, institutions shall ensure the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 6 are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure of the facility shall ensure that under all foreseeable circumstances the institution has effective ownership and control of all cash remittances from the receivables. When the obligor makes payments directly to a seller or servicer, the institution shall verify regularly that payments are forwarded completely and within the contractually agreed terms. Institutions shall have procedures to ensure that ownership over the receivables and cash receipts is protected against bankruptcy stays or legal challenges that could materially delay the lender&#x27;s ability to liquidate or assign the receivables or retain control over cash receipts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institution shall monitor both the quality of the purchased receivables and the financial condition of the seller and servicer. The following shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall assess the correlation among the quality of the purchased receivables and the financial condition of both the seller and servicer, and have in place internal policies and procedures that provide adequate safeguards to protect against any contingencies, including the assignment of an internal risk rating for each seller and servicer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have clear and effective policies and procedures for determining seller and servicer eligibility. The institution or its agent shall conduct periodic reviews of sellers and servicers in order to verify the accuracy of reports from the seller or servicer, detect fraud or operational weaknesses, and verify the quality of the seller&#x27;s credit policies and servicer&#x27;s collection policies and procedures. The findings of these reviews shall be documented;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall assess the characteristics of the purchased receivables pools, including over-advances; history of the seller&#x27;s arrears, bad debts, and bad debt allowances; payment terms, and potential contra accounts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have effective policies and procedures for monitoring on an aggregate basis single-obligor concentrations both within and across purchased receivables pools;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall ensure that it receives from the servicer timely and sufficiently detailed reports of receivables ageings and dilutions to ensure compliance with the institution&#x27;s eligibility criteria and advancing policies governing purchased receivables, and provide an effective means with which to monitor and confirm the seller&#x27;s terms of sale and dilution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall have systems and procedures for detecting deteriorations in the seller&#x27;s financial condition and purchased receivables quality at an early stage, and for addressing emerging problems pro-actively. In particular, the institution shall have clear and effective policies, procedures, and information systems to monitor covenant violations, and clear and effective policies and procedures for initiating legal actions and dealing with problem purchased receivables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall have clear and effective policies and procedures governing the control of purchased receivables, credit, and cash. In particular, written internal policies shall specify all material elements of the receivables purchase programme, including the advancing rates, eligible collateral, necessary documentation, concentration limits, and the way cash receipts are to be handled. These elements shall take appropriate account of all relevant and material factors, including the seller and servicer&#x27;s financial condition, risk concentrations, and trends in the quality of the purchased receivables and the seller&#x27;s customer base, and internal systems shall ensure that funds are advanced only against specified supporting collateral and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall have an effective internal process for assessing compliance with all internal policies and procedures. The process shall include regular audits of all critical phases of the institution&#x27;s receivables purchase programme, verification of the separation of duties between firstly the assessment of the seller and servicer and the assessment of the obligor and secondly between the assessment of the seller and servicer and the field audit of the seller and servicer, and evaluations of back office operations, with particular focus on qualifications, experience, staffing levels, and supporting automation systems.&lt;/li&gt;

Institutions using own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall also perform analogous analysis for these estimates. Such comparisons shall make use of historical data that cover as long a period as possible. The institution shall document the methods and data used in such comparisons. This analysis and documentation shall be updated at least annually;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the estimate of potential loss shall be robust to adverse market movements relevant to the long-term risk profile of the institution&#x27;s specific holdings. The data used to represent return distributions shall reflect the longest sample period for which data is available and meaningful in representing the risk profile of the institution&#x27;s specific equity exposures. The data used shall be sufficient to provide conservative, statistically reliable and robust loss estimates that are not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations. The shock employed shall provide a conservative estimate of potential losses over a relevant long-term market or business cycle. The institution shall combine empirical analysis of available data with adjustments based on a variety of factors in order to attain model outputs that achieve appropriate realism and conservatism. In constructing value at risk (VaR) models estimating potential quarterly losses, institutions may use quarterly data or convert shorter horizon period data to a quarterly equivalent using an analytically appropriate method supported by empirical evidence and through a well-developed and documented thought process and analysis. Such an approach shall be applied conservatively and consistently over time. Where only limited relevant data is available the institution shall add appropriate margins of conservatism;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the models used shall capture adequately all of the material risks embodied in equity returns including both the general market risk and specific risk exposure of the institution&#x27;s equity portfolio. The internal models shall adequately explain historical price variation, capture both the magnitude and changes in the composition of potential concentrations, and be robust to adverse market environments. The population of risk exposures represented in the data used for estimation shall be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the institution&#x27;s equity exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal model shall be appropriate for the risk profile and complexity of an institution&#x27;s equity portfolio. Where an institution has material holdings with values that are highly non-linear in nature the internal models shall be designed to capture appropriately the risks associated with such instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapping of individual positions to proxies, market indices, and risk factors shall be plausible, intuitive, and conceptually sound;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall demonstrate through empirical analyses the appropriateness of risk factors, including their ability to cover both general and specific risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the estimates of the return volatility of equity exposures shall incorporate relevant and available data, information, and methods. Independently reviewed internal data or data from external sources including pooled data shall be used;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;No exposure in respect of which an institution obtains credit risk mitigation shall produce a higher risk-weighted exposure amount or expected loss amount than an otherwise identical exposure in respect of which an institution has no credit risk mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the risk-weighted exposure amount already takes account of credit protection under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, as applicable, institutions shall not take into account that credit protection in the calculations under this Chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the provisions in Sections 2 and 3 are met, institutions may amend the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach and the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4, 5 and 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall treat cash, securities or commodities purchased, borrowed or received under a repurchase transaction or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transaction as collateral.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The technique used to provide the credit protection together with the actions and steps taken and procedures and policies implemented by the lending institution shall be such as to result in credit protection arrangements which are legally effective and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions.&lt;br&gt;The lending institution shall provide, upon request of the competent authority, the most recent version of the independent, written and reasoned legal opinion or opinions that it used to establish whether its credit protection arrangement or arrangements meet the condition laid down in the first subparagraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lending institution shall take all appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of the credit protection arrangement and to address the risks related to that arrangement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions may recognise funded credit protection in the calculation of the effect of credit risk mitigation only where the assets relied upon for protection meet both of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are included in the list of eligible assets set out in Articles 197 to 200, as applicable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are sufficiently liquid and their value over time sufficiently stable to provide appropriate certainty as to the credit protection achieved having regard to the approach used to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and to the degree of recognition allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions may recognise funded credit protection in the calculation of the effect of credit risk mitigation only where the lending institution has the right to liquidate or retain, in a timely manner, the assets from which the protection derives in the event of the default, insolvency or bankruptcy — or other credit event set out in the transaction documentation — of the obligor and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral. The degree of correlation between the value of the assets relied upon for protection and the credit quality of the obligor shall not be too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of unfunded credit protection, a protection provider shall qualify as an eligible protection provider only where the protection provider is included in the list of eligible protection providers set out in Article 201 or 202, as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of unfunded credit protection, a protection agreement shall qualify as an eligible protection agreement only where it meets both the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is included in the list of eligible protection agreements set out in Articles 203 and 204(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is legally effective and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions, to provide appropriate certainty as to the credit protection achieved having regard to the approach used to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and to the degree of recognition allowed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the protection provider meets the criteria laid down in paragraph 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit protection shall comply with the requirements set out in Section 3, as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall be able to demonstrate to competent authorities that it has adequate risk management processes to control those risks to which it may be exposed as a result of carrying out credit risk mitigation practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding the fact that credit risk mitigation has been taken into account for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and, where applicable, expected loss amounts, institutions shall continue to undertake a full credit risk assessment of the underlying exposure and be in a position to demonstrate the fulfilment of this requirement to the competent authorities. In the case of repurchase transactions and securities lending or commodities lending or borrowing transactions the underlying exposure shall, for the purposes of this paragraph only, be deemed to be the net amount of the exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what constitutes sufficiently liquid assets and when asset values can be considered as sufficiently stable for the purpose of paragraph 3.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 September 2014.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

Institutions shall maintain a continuous monitoring process appropriate to the receivables. They shall also review, on a regular basis, compliance with loan covenants, environmental restrictions, and other legal requirements;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;would increase the effective cost of protection as a result of a deterioration in the credit quality of the protected exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original obligor fails to make any payments due, or when the leasing contract has expired for the purposes of recognising guaranteed residual value under Articles 134(7) and 166(4);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could allow the maturity of the credit protection to be reduced by the protection provider;&lt;/li&gt;

An institution shall be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities how its strategy in respect of its use of credit derivatives and guarantees interacts with its management of its overall risk profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall fulfil any contractual and statutory requirements in respect of, and take all steps necessary to ensure, the enforceability of its unfunded credit protection under the law applicable to its interest in the credit protection.&lt;br&gt;An institution shall have conducted sufficient legal review confirming the enforceability of the unfunded credit protection in all relevant jurisdictions.

&lt;li&gt;the underlying obligation is to one of the following exposures:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a corporate exposure as referred to in Article 147, excluding insurance and reinsurance undertakings;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an exposure to a regional government, local authority or public sector entity which is not treated as an exposure to a central government or a central bank in accordance with Article 147;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an exposure to an SME, classified as a retail exposure in accordance with Article 147(5);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the underlying obligors are not members of the same group as the protection provider;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exposure is hedged by one of the following instruments:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single-name unfunded credit derivatives or single-name guarantees;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first-to-default basket products;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the credit protection meets the requirements set out in Articles 213, 215 and 216, as applicable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the risk weight that is associated with the exposure prior to the application of the treatment set out in Article 153(3), does not already factor in any aspect of the credit protection;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution has the right and expectation to receive payment from the protection provider without having to take legal action in order to pursue the counterparty for payment. To the extent possible, the institution shall take steps to satisfy itself that the protection provider is willing to pay promptly should a credit event occur;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purchased credit protection absorbs all credit losses incurred on the hedged portion of an exposure that arise due to the occurrence of credit events outlined in the contract;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the payout structure of the credit protection provides for physical settlement, there is legal certainty with respect to the deliverability of a loan, bond, or contingent liability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where an institution intends to deliver an obligation other than the underlying exposure, it shall ensure that the deliverable obligation is sufficiently liquid so that the institution would have the ability to purchase it for delivery in accordance with the contract;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the terms and conditions of credit protection arrangements are legally confirmed in writing by both the protection provider and the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions have in place a process to detect excessive correlation between the creditworthiness of a protection provider and the obligor of the underlying exposure due to their performance being dependent on common factors beyond the systematic risk factor;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the institution has established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of the risk-measurement system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution&#x27;s models have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks demonstrated through the back-testing of its output using at least one year of data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution frequently conducts a rigorous programme of stress testing and the results of these tests are reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it sets;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it shall be based on an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data set used in the calculation shall be updated every three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where an institution has a repurchase transaction, a securities or commodities lending or borrowing transaction and margin lending or similar transaction or netting set which meets the criteria set out in Article 285(2), (3) and (4), the minimum holding period shall be brought in line with the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs, in combination with Article 285(5).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall assign to those portions of exposure values that are collateralised by the market value of eligible collateral the risk weight that they would assign under Chapter 2 where the lending institution had a direct exposure to the collateral instrument. For this purpose, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet item listed in Annex I shall be equal to 100 % of the item&#x27;s value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(1).&lt;br&gt;The risk weight of the collateralised portion shall be at least 20 % except as specified in paragraphs 4 to 6. Institutions shall apply to the remainder of the exposure value the risk weight that they would assign to an unsecured exposure to the counterparty under Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 0 % to the collateralised portion of the exposure arising from repurchase transaction and securities lending or borrowing transactions which fulfil the criteria in Article 227. Where the counterparty to the transaction is not a core market participant, institutions shall assign a risk weight of 10 %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 0 %, to the extent of the collateralisation, to the exposure values determined under Chapter 6 for the derivative instruments listed in Annex II and subject to daily marking-to-market, collateralised by cash or cash assimilated instruments where there is no currency mismatch.&lt;br&gt;Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 10 %, to the extent of the collateralisation, to the exposure values of such transactions collateralised by debt securities issued by central governments or central banks which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For transactions other than those referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, institutions may assign a 0 % risk weight where the exposure and the collateral are denominated in the same currency, and either of the following conditions is met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the collateral is cash on deposit or a cash assimilated instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the collateral is in the form of debt securities issued by central governments or central banks eligible for a 0 % risk weight under Article 114, and its market value has been discounted by 20 %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 debt securities issued by central governments or central banks shall include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt securities issued by regional governments or local authorities exposures to which are treated as exposures to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established under Article 115;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt securities issued by multilateral development banks to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned under or by virtue of Article 117(2);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt securities issued by international organisations which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Article 118;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt securities issued by public sector entities which are treated as exposures to central governments in accordance with Article 116(4).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In order to take account of price volatility, institutions shall apply volatility adjustments to the market value of collateral, as set out in Articles 224 to 227, when valuing financial collateral for the purposes of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method.&lt;br&gt;Where collateral is denominated in a currency that differs from the currency in which the underlying exposure is denominated, institutions shall add an adjustment reflecting currency volatility to the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral as set out in Articles 224 to 227.&lt;br&gt;In the case of OTC derivatives transactions covered by netting agreements recognised by the competent authorities under Chapter 6, institutions shall apply a volatility adjustment reflecting currency volatility when there is a mismatch between the collateral currency and the settlement currency. Even where multiple currencies are involved in the transactions covered by the netting agreement, institutions shall apply a single volatility adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall calculate the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (C &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; VA &lt;/span&gt; ) they need to take into account as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet item listed in Annex I shall be 100 % of that item&#x27;s value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the IRB Approach, they shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall calculate the fully adjusted value of the exposure (E*), taking into account both volatility and the risk-mitigating effects of collateral as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions may calculate volatility adjustments either by using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach referred to in Article 224 or the Own Estimates Approach referred to in Article 225.&lt;br&gt;An institution may choose to use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach or the Own Estimates Approach independently of the choice it has made between the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts.&lt;br&gt;However, where an institution uses the Own Estimates Approach, it shall do so for the full range of instrument types, excluding immaterial portfolios where it may use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for repurchase transactions, except insofar as such transactions involve the transfer of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities, and securities lending or borrowing transactions the liquidation period shall be 5 business days;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for other capital market driven transactions, the liquidation period shall be 10 business days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where an institution has a transaction or netting set which meets the criteria set out in Article 285(2), (3) and (4), the minimum holding period shall be brought in line with the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Tables 1 to 4 of paragraph 1 and in paragraphs 4 to 6, the credit quality step with which a credit assessment of the debt security is associated is the credit quality step with which the credit assessment is determined by EBA to be associated under Chapter 2.&lt;br&gt;For the purpose of determining the credit quality step with which a credit assessment of the debt security is associated referred to in the first subparagraph, Article 197(7) also applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For non-eligible securities or for commodities lent or sold under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the volatility adjustment is the same as for non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For eligible units in CIUs the volatility adjustment is the weighted average volatility adjustments that would apply, having regard to the liquidation period of the transaction as specified in paragraph 2, to the assets in which the fund has invested.&lt;br&gt;Where the assets in which the fund has invested are not known to the institution, the volatility adjustment is the highest volatility adjustment that would apply to any of the assets in which the fund has the right to invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For unrated debt securities issued by institutions and satisfying the eligibility criteria in Article 197(4) the volatility adjustments is the same as for securities issued by institutions or corporates with an external credit assessment associated with credit quality step 2 or 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Supervisory volatility adjustment under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method</td><td>Article 224</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities shall permit institutions to use their own volatility estimates for calculating the volatility adjustments to be applied to collateral and exposures where those institutions comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.

&lt;li&gt;the transaction documentation reflects the economic substance of the securitisation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit protection by virtue of which credit risk is transferred complies with Article 249;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the securitisation documentation does not contain terms or conditions that:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impose significant materiality thresholds below which credit protection is deemed not to be triggered if a credit event occurs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow for the termination of the protection due to deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;require the originator institution to alter the composition of the underlying exposures to improve the average quality of the pool; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase the institution’s cost of credit protection or the yield payable to holders of positions in the securitisation in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying pool;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the credit protection is enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where applicable, the transaction documentation makes it clear that the originator or the sponsor may only purchase or repurchase securitisation positions or repurchase, restructure or substitute the underlying exposures beyond their contractual obligations where such arrangements are executed in accordance with prevailing market conditions and the parties to them act in their own interest as free and independent parties (arm’s length);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where there is a clean-up call option, that option meets all the following conditions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it may be exercised at the discretion of the originator institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it may only be exercised when 10 % or less of the original value of the underlying exposures remains unamortised;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not structured to avoid allocating losses to credit enhancement positions or other positions held by investors in the securitisation and is not otherwise structured to provide credit enhancement;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EBA shall monitor the range of supervisory practices in relation to the recognition of significant risk transfer in synthetic securitisations in accordance with this Article. In particular, the EBA shall review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the conditions for the transfer of significant credit risk to third parties in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the exposure value of an on-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its accounting value remaining after any relevant specific credit risk adjustments on the securitisation position have been applied in accordance with Article 110;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exposure value of an off-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its nominal value less any relevant specific credit risk adjustments on the securitisation position in accordance with Article 110, multiplied by the relevant conversion factor as set out in this point. The conversion factor shall be 100 %, except in the case of cash advance facilities. To determine the exposure value of the undrawn portion of the cash advance facilities, a conversion factor of 0 % may be applied to the nominal amount of a liquidity facility that is unconditionally cancellable provided that repayment of draws on the facility are senior to any other claims on the cash flows arising from the underlying exposures and the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that it is applying an appropriately conservative method for measuring the amount of the undrawn portion;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exposure value for the counterparty credit risk of a securitisation position that results from a derivative instrument listed in Annex II, shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 6;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position which is assigned 1250 % risk weight in accordance with Subsection 3 or deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1), the amount of the specific credit risk adjustments on the underlying exposures in accordance with Article 110, and any non-refundable purchase price discounts connected with such underlying exposures to the extent that such discounts have caused the reduction of own funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what constitutes an appropriately conservative method for measuring the amount of the undrawn portion referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph.&lt;br&gt;The EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 January 2019.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an institution has two or more overlapping positions in a securitisation, it shall include only one of the positions in its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts.&lt;br&gt;Where the positions partially overlap, the institution may split the position into two parts and recognise the overlap in relation to one part only in accordance with the first subparagraph. Alternatively, the institution may treat the positions as if they were fully overlapping by expanding for capital calculation purposes the position that produces the higher risk-weighted exposure amounts.&lt;br&gt;The institution may also recognise an overlap between the specific risk own funds requirements for positions in the trading book and the own funds requirements for securitisation positions in the non-trading book, provided that the institution is able to calculate and compare the own funds requirements for the relevant positions.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this paragraph, two positions shall be deemed to be overlapping where they are mutually offsetting in such a manner that the institution is able to preclude the losses arising from one position by performing the obligations required under the other position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where point (d) of Article 270c applies to positions in an ABCP, the institution may use the risk weight assigned to a liquidity facility in order to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for the ABCP, provided that the liquidity facility covers 100 % of the ABCP issued by the ABCP programme and the liquidity facility ranks pari passu with the ABCP in a manner that they form an overlapping position. The institution shall notify the competent authorities where it has applied the provisions laid down in this paragraph.

The requirement set out in this subparagraph shall not apply to qualifying central counterparties.&lt;br&gt;Institutions which are allowed to apply the IRB Approach to a direct exposure to the protection provider may assess eligibility in accordance with the first subparagraph based on the equivalence of the PD for the protection provider to the PD associated with the credit quality steps referred to in Article 136.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where an institution applies the SEC-IRBA under Subsection 3, the institution shall calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall determine K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated under Chapter 3 in respect of the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised by 8 % divided by the exposure value of the underlying exposures. K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; shall be expressed in decimal form between zero and one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; calculation purposes, the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated under Chapter 3 in respect of the underlying exposures shall include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of expected losses associated with all the underlying exposures of the securitisation including defaulted underlying exposures that are still part of the pool in accordance with Chapter 3; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of unexpected losses associated with all the underlying exposures including defaulted underlying exposures in the pool in accordance with Chapter 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions may calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; in relation to the underlying exposures of the securitisation in accordance with the provisions set out in Chapter 3 for the calculation of capital requirements for purchased receivables. For these purposes, retail exposures shall be treated as purchased retail receivables and non-retail exposures as purchased corporate receivables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; separately for dilution risk in relation to the underlying exposures of a securitisation where dilution risk is material to such exposures.&lt;br&gt;Where losses from dilution and credit risks are treated in an aggregate manner in the securitisation, institutions shall combine the respective K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; for dilution and credit risk into a single K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; for the purposes of Subsection 3. The presence of a single reserve fund or overcollateralisation available to cover losses from either credit or dilution risk may be regarded as an indication that these risks are treated in an aggregate manner.&lt;br&gt;Where dilution and credit risk are not treated in an aggregate manner in the securitisation, institutions shall modify the treatment set out in the second subparagraph to combine the respective K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; for dilution and credit risk in a prudent manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an institution applies the SEC-SA under Subsection 3, it shall calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; SA &lt;/span&gt; by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated under Chapter 2 in respect of the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised by 8 % divided by the value of the underlying exposures. K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; SA &lt;/span&gt; shall be expressed in decimal form between zero and one.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the underlying exposures without netting any specific credit risk adjustments and additional value adjustments in accordance with Articles 34 and 110 and other own funds reductions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 6, where a securitisation structure involves the use of an SSPE, all the SSPE’s exposures related to the securitisation shall be treated as underlying exposures. Without prejudice to the preceding, the institution may exclude the SSPE’s exposures from the pool of underlying exposures for K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; or K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; SA &lt;/span&gt; calculation purposes if the risk from the SSPE’s exposures is immaterial or if it does not affect the institution’s securitisation position.&lt;br&gt;In the case of funded synthetic securitisations, any material proceeds from the issuance of credit-linked notes or other funded obligations of the SSPE that serve as collateral for the repayment of the securitisation positions shall be included in the calculation of K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; or K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; SA &lt;/span&gt; if the credit risk of the collateral is subject to the tranched loss allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of the third subparagraph of paragraph 5 of this Article, the EBA shall issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 on the appropriate methods to combine K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; for dilution and credit risk where these risks are not treated in an aggregate manner in a securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions to allow institutions to calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; for the pools of underlying exposures in accordance with paragraph 4, in particular with regard to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal credit policy and models for calculating K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; for securitisations;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;due diligence requirements to monitor the actions and policies of sellers of receivables or other originators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 January 2019.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of Subsection 3, institutions shall set the detachment point (D) at the threshold at which losses within the pool of underlying exposures would result in a complete loss of principal for the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position.&lt;br&gt;The detachment point (D) shall be expressed as a decimal value between zero and one and shall be equal to the greater of zero and the ratio of the outstanding balance of the pool of underlying exposures in the securitisation minus the outstanding balance of all tranches that rank senior to the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position to the outstanding balance of all the underlying exposures in the securitisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall treat overcollateralisation and funded reserve accounts as tranches and the assets comprising such reserve accounts as underlying exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall disregard unfunded reserve accounts and assets that do not provide credit enhancement, such as those that only provide liquidity support, currency or interest rate swaps and cash collateral accounts related to those positions in the securitisation. For funded reserve accounts and assets providing credit enhancement, the institution shall only treat as securitisation positions the parts of those accounts or assets that are loss-absorbing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where two or more positions of the same transaction have different maturities but share pro rata loss allocation, the calculation of the attachment points (A) and the detachment points (D) shall be based on the aggregated outstanding balance of those positions and the resulting attachment points (A) and detachment points (D) shall be the same.&lt;/li&gt;

The weights shall be the stand-alone IRB Approach capital requirements for credit risk and dilution risk, respectively. For these purposes, the presence of a single reserve fund or overcollateralisation available to cover losses from either credit or dilution risk may be regarded as an indication that these risks are managed in an aggregate manner.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where the position is backed by a mixed pool and the institution is able to calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; on at least 95 % of the underlying exposure amounts in accordance with point (a) of Article 258(1), the institution shall calculate the capital charge for the pool of underlying exposures as:#FORMULA#whered is the share of the exposure amount of underlying exposures for which the institution can calculate K &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; IRB &lt;/span&gt; over the exposure amount of all underlying exposures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the internal assessment of the credit quality of the position reflects the publicly available assessment methodology of one or more ECAIs for the rating of securitisation positions backed by underlying exposures of the type securitised;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme is predominantly issued to third-party investors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution’s internal assessment process is at least as conservative as the publicly available assessments of those ECAIs which have provided an external rating for the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme, in particular with regard to stress factors and other relevant quantitative elements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution’s internal assessment methodology takes into account all relevant publicly available rating methodologies of the ECAIs that rate the commercial paper of the ABCP programme and includes rating grades corresponding to the credit assessments of ECAIs. The institution shall document in its internal records an explanatory statement describing how the requirements set out in this point have been met and shall update such statement on a regular basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution uses the internal assessment methodology for internal risk management purposes, including in its decision-making, management information and internal capital allocation processes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal or external auditors, an ECAI, or the institution’s internal credit review or risk management function perform regular reviews of the internal assessment process and the quality of the internal assessments of the credit quality of the institution’s exposures to an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution tracks the performance of its internal ratings over time to evaluate the performance of its internal assessment methodology and makes adjustments, as necessary, to that methodology when the performance of the exposures routinely diverges from that indicated by the internal ratings;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ABCP programme includes underwriting and liability management standards in the form of guidelines to the programme administrator on, at least:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the asset eligibility criteria, subject to point (j);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the types and monetary value of the exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit enhancements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the loss distribution between the securitisation positions in the ABCP programme or ABCP transaction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legal and economic isolation of the transferred assets from the entity selling the assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the asset eligibility criteria in the ABCP programme provide for, at least:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exclusion of the purchase of assets that are significantly past due or defaulted;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limitation of excessive concentration to individual obligor or geographic area; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limitation of the tenor of the assets to be purchased;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an analysis of the asset seller’s credit risk and business profile is performed including, at least, an assessment of the seller’s:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;past and expected future financial performance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current market position and expected future competitiveness;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leverage, cash flow, interest coverage and debt rating; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;underwriting standards, servicing capabilities, and collection processes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ABCP programme has collection policies and processes that take into account the operational capability and credit quality of the servicer and comprises features that mitigate performance-related risks of the seller and the servicer. For the purposes of this point, performance-related risks may be mitigated through triggers based on the seller or servicer’s current credit quality to prevent commingling of funds in the event of the seller’s or servicer’s default;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the aggregated estimate of loss on an asset pool that may be purchased under the ABCP programme takes into account all sources of potential risk, such as credit and dilution risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the seller-provided credit enhancement is sized based only on credit-related losses and dilution risk is material for the particular asset pool, the ABCP programme comprises a separate reserve for dilution risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of the required enhancement level in the ABCP programme is calculated taking into account several years of historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions, and the turnover rate of the receivables;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ABCP programme comprises structural features in the purchase of exposures in order to mitigate potential credit deterioration of the underlying portfolio. Such features may include wind-down triggers specific to a pool of exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution evaluates the characteristics of the underlying asset pool, such as its weighted-average credit score, and identifies any concentrations to an individual obligor or geographic area and the granularity of the asset pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the institution’s internal audit, credit review, or risk management functions perform the review provided for in point (g) of paragraph 2, those functions shall be independent from the institution’s internal functions dealing with ABCP programme business and customer relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions which have received permission to apply the Internal Assessment Approach shall not revert to the use of other methods for positions that fall within scope of application of the Internal Assessment Approach unless both of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the institution has good cause to do so;&lt;/li&gt;

The position shall be attributed a derived rating which shall be the same as the credit assessments corresponding to that rating grade as laid down in point (e) of Article 265(2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rating derived in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be at least at the level of investment grade or better at the time it was first assigned and shall be regarded as an eligible credit assessment by an ECAI for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Article 263 or Article 264, as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the case of pools of underlying exposures where the institution uses exclusively the Standardised Approach or the IRB Approach, the maximum risk weight of the senior securitisation position shall be equal to the exposure-weighted-average risk weight that would apply to the underlying exposures under Chapter 2 or 3, respectively, as if they had not been securitised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of mixed pools the maximum risk weight shall be calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

For the purposes of this Article, the IRB Approach capital requirement shall include the amount of the expected losses associated with those exposures calculated under Chapter 3 and that of unexpected losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of mixed pools, the maximum capital requirement shall be determined by calculating the exposure-weighted average of the capital requirements of the IRB Approach and Standardised Approach portions of the underlying exposures in accordance with paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maximum capital requirement shall be the result of multiplying the amount calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2 by the largest proportion of interest that the institution holds in the relevant tranches (V), expressed as a percentage and calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transaction types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long settlement transactions means transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date specified by contract that is later than the market standard for this particular type of transaction or five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction, whichever is earlier;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin lending transactions means transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that are secured by collateral in the form of securities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netting set, hedging sets, and related terms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;netting set means a group of transactions between an institution and a single counterparty that is subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recognised under Section 7 and Chapter 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement which is recognised under Section 7 shall be treated as its own netting set for the purposes of this Chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6, all netting sets with a single counterparty may be treated as a single netting set if negative simulated market values of the individual netting sets are set to 0 in the estimation of expected exposure (hereinafter referred to as EE);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk position means a risk number that is assigned to a transaction under the Standardised Method set out in Section5 following a predetermined algorithm;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hedging set means a group of risk positions arising from the transactions within a single netting set, where only the balance of those risk positions is used for determining the exposure value under the Standardised Method set out in Section 5;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin agreement means an agreement or provisions of an agreement under which one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an exposure of that second counterparty to the first counterparty exceeds a specified level;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin threshold means the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding before one party has the right to call for collateral;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin period of risk means the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterparty until the transactions are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effective maturity under the Internal Model Method for a netting set with maturity greater than one year means the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate of return, divided by the sum of expected exposure over one year in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cross-product netting means the inclusion of transactions of different product categories within the same netting set pursuant to the cross-product netting rules set out in this Chapter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Market Value (hereinafter referred to as CMV) for the purposes of Section 5 refers to the net market value of the portfolio of transactions within a netting set, where both positive and negative market values are used in computing the CMV;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distribution of market values means the forecast of the probability distribution of net market values of transactions within a netting set for a future date (the forecasting horizon), given the realised market value of those transactions at the date of the forecast;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distribution of exposures means the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk-neutral distribution means a distribution of market values or exposures over a future time period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actual distribution means a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time period where the distribution is calculated using historic or realised values such as volatilities calculated using past price or rate changes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure measures and adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current exposure means the larger of zero and the market value of a transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in insolvency or liquidation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peak exposure means a high percentile of the distribution of exposures at particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected exposure (hereinafter referred to as EE) means the average of the distribution of exposures at a particular future date before the longest maturity transaction in the netting set matures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effective expected exposure at a specific date (hereinafter referred to as Effective EE) means the maximum expected exposure that occurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as the greater of the expected exposure at that date or the effective expected exposure at any prior date;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected positive exposure (hereinafter referred to as EPE) means the weighted average over time of expected exposures, where the weights are the proportion of the entire time period that an individual expected exposure represents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calculating the own funds requirement, institutions shall take the average over the first year or, if all the contracts within the netting set mature within less than one year, over the time period until the contract with the longest maturity in the netting set has matured;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effective expected positive exposure (hereinafter referred to as Effective EPE) means the weighted average of effective expected exposure over the first year of a netting set or, if all the contracts within the netting set mature within less than one year, over the time period of the longest maturity contract in the netting set, where the weights are the proportion of the entire time period that an individual expected exposure represents;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCR related risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rollover risk means the amount by which EPE is understated when future transactions with a counterparty are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional exposure generated by those future transactions is not included in calculation of EPE;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;counterparty for the purposes of Section 7 means any legal or natural person that enters into a netting agreement, and has the contractual capacity to do so;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contractual cross product netting agreement means a bilateral contractual agreement between an institution and a counterparty which creates a single legal obligation (based on netting of covered transactions) covering all bilateral master agreements and transactions belonging to different product categories that are included within the agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this definition, different product categories means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repurchase transactions, securities and commodities lending and borrowing transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin lending transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contracts listed in Annex II;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment leg means the payment agreed in an OTC derivative transaction with a linear risk profile which stipulates the exchange of a financial instrument for a payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of transactions that stipulate the exchange of payment against payment, those two payment legs shall consist of the contractually agreed gross payments, including the notional amount of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall determine the exposure value for the contracts listed in Annex II on the basis of one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 in accordance with this Article.&lt;br&gt;An institution which is not eligible for the treatment set out in Article 94 shall not use the method set out in Section 4. To determine the exposure value for the contracts listed in point 3 of Annex II an institution shall not use the method set out in Section 4. Institutions may use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis within a group. A single institution shall not use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis but shall be permitted to use in combination methods set out in Sections 3 and 5 when one of the methods is used for the cases set out in Article 282(6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where permitted by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1) and (2), an institution may determine the exposure value for the following items using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contracts listed in Annex II;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repurchase transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin lending transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long settlement transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an institution purchases protection through a credit derivative against a non-trading book exposure or against a counterparty risk exposure, it may calculate its own funds requirement for the hedged exposure in accordance with either of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articles 233 to 236;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in accordance with Article 153(3), or Article 183, where permission has been granted in accordance with Article 143.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The exposure value for CCR for those credit derivatives shall be zero, unless an institution applies the approach in point (h)(ii) of Article 299(2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding paragraph 3, an institution may choose consistently to include for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk all credit derivatives not included in the trading book and purchased as protection against a non-trading book exposure or against a counterparty credit risk exposure where the credit protection is recognised under this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where credit default swaps sold by an institution are treated by an institution as credit protection provided by that institution and are subject to own funds requirement for credit risk of the underlying for the full notional amount, their exposure value for the purposes of CCR in the non-trading book shall be zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under all methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, the exposure value for a given counterparty shall be equal to the sum of the exposure values calculated for each netting set with that counterparty.&lt;br&gt;For a given counterparty, the exposure value for a given netting set of OTC derivative instruments listed in Annex II calculated in accordance with this Chapter shall be the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of exposure values across all netting sets with the counterparty and the sum of CVA for that counterparty being recognised by the institution as an incurred write-down. The credit valuation adjustments shall be calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit value adjustment attributed to the own credit risk of the firm that has been already excluded from own funds under Article 33(1)(c).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall determine the exposure value for exposures arising from long settlement transactions by any of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, regardless of which method the institution has chosen for treating OTC derivatives and repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, and margin lending transactions. In calculating the own funds requirements for long settlement transactions, an institution that uses the approach set out in Chapter 3 may assign the risk weights under the approach set out in Chapter 2 on a permanent basis and irrespective of the materiality of such positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the methods set out in Sections 3 and 4, the institution shall adopt a consistent methodology for determining the notional amount for different product types, and shall ensure that the notional amount to be taken into account provides an appropriate measure of the risk inherent in the contract. Where the contract provides for a multiplication of cash flows, the notional amount shall be adjusted by an institution to take into account the effects of the multiplication on the risk structure of that contract.&lt;br&gt;For the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, institutions shall treat transactions where specific wrong way risk has been identified in accordance with Article 291(2), (4), (5) and (6) as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In order to determine the current replacement cost of all contracts with positive values, institutions shall attach the current market values to the contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine the potential future credit exposure, institutions shall multiply the notional amounts or underlying values, as applicable, by the percentages in Table 1 and in accordance with the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracts which do not fall within one of the five categories indicated in Table 1 shall be treated as contracts concerning commodities other than precious metals;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the percentages shall be multiplied by the number of remaining payments still to be made in accordance with the contract;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset so that the market value of the contract is zero on those specified dates, the residual maturity shall be equal to the time until the next reset date. In the case of interest-rate contracts that meet those criteria and have a remaining maturity of over one year, the percentage shall be no lower than 0,5 %.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;Where an institution is permitted to use the IMM to calculate exposure value for any of the transactions mentioned in points (a) to (c) of the first subparagraph, it may also use the IMM for the transactions in Article 273(2)(e).&lt;br&gt;Notwithstanding the third subparagraph of Article 273(1), an institution may choose not to apply this method to exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. In such case, an institution shall apply one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 5 to these exposures where the relevant requirements for each approach are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall permit institutions to use IMM for the calculations referred to in paragraph 1 only if the institution has demonstrated that it complies with the requirements set out in this Section, and the competent authorities verified that the systems for the management of CCR maintained by the institution are sound and properly implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities may permit institutions for a limited period to implement the IMM sequentially across different transaction types. During this period of sequential implementation institutions may use the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 for transaction type for which they do not use the IMM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all OTC derivative transactions and for long settlement transactions for which an institution has not received permission under paragraph 1 to use the IMM, the institution shall use the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5.&lt;br&gt;Those methods may be used in combination on a permanent basis within a group. Within an institution those methods may be used in combination only where one of the methods is used for the cases set out in Article 282(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution which is permitted in accordance with paragraph 1 to use the IMM shall not revert to the use of the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 unless it is permitted by the competent authority to do so. Competent authorities shall give such permission if the institution demonstrates good cause.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where an institution is permitted, in accordance with Article 283(1), to use the IMM to calculate the exposure value of some or all transactions mentioned in that paragraph, it shall measure the exposure value of those transactions at the level of the netting set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model used by the institution for that purpose shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to joint changes in relevant market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calculate the exposure value for the netting set at each of the future dates on the basis of the joint changes in the market variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order for the model to capture the effects of margining, the model of the collateral value shall meet the quantitative, qualitative and data requirements for the IMM in accordance with this Section and the institution may include in its forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set only eligible financial collateral as referred to in Articles 197 and 198 and points (c) and (d) of Article 299(2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The own funds requirement for counterparty credit risk with respect to the CCR exposures to which an institution applies the IMM, shall be the higher of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of Effective EPE using current market data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of Effective EPE using a single consistent stress calibration for all CCR exposures to which they apply the IMM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for counterparties identified as having Specific Wrong-Way risk that fall within the scope of Article 291(4) and (5), institutions shall calculate the exposure value as the product of alpha (α) times Effective EPE, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure value = α · Effective EPE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt; =1.4, unless competent authorities require a higher α or permit institutions to use their own estimates in accordance with paragraph 9;&lt;/p&gt;Effective EPE shall be calculated by estimating expected exposure (EEt) as the average exposure at future date t, where the average is taken across possible future values of relevant market risk factors.&lt;br&gt;The model shall estimate EE at a series of future dates t1, t2, t3, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective EE shall be calculated recursively as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#FORMULA#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrListNoStyle&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the current date is denoted as t &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; 0 &lt;/span&gt; ;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective EE &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; t0 &lt;/span&gt; equals current exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective EPE is the average Effective EE during the first year of future exposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature within less than one year, EPE shall be the average of EE until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE shall be calculated as a weighted average of Effective EE:#FORMULA#where the weights #FORMULA# allow for the case when future exposure is calculated at dates that are not equally spaced over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall calculate EE or peak exposure measures on the basis of a distribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non-normality of the distribution of exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution may use a measure of the distribution calculated by the IMM that is more conservative than α multiplied by Effective EPE as calculated in accordance with the equation in paragraph 4 for every counterparty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding paragraph 4, competent authorities may permit institutions to use their own estimates of alpha, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alpha shall equal the ratio of internal capital from a full simulation of CCR exposure across counterparties (numerator) and internal capital based on EPE (denominator);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the denominator, EPE shall be used as if it were a fixed outstanding amount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;When estimated in accordance with this paragraph, alpha shall be no lower than 1,2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of an estimate of alpha under paragraph 9, an institution shall ensure that the numerator and denominator are calculated in a manner consistent with the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used to estimate α shall be based on the institution&#x27;s internal capital approach, be well documented and be subject to independent validation. In addition, an institution shall review its estimates of alpha on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. An institution shall also assess the model risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that its internal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator material sources of dependency of distribution of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties. Internal estimates of alpha shall take account of the granularity of portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In supervising the use of estimates under paragraph 9, competent authorities shall have regard to the significant variation in estimates of alpha that arises from the potential for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint modelling of market and credit risk shall be conditioned on the credit risk factor to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and daily mark-to-market valuation, the institution shall calculate Effective EPE as set out in this paragraph. If the model captures the effects of margining when estimating EE, the institution may, subject to the permission of the competent authority, use the model&#x27;s EE measure directly in the equation in Article 284(5). Competent authorities shall grant such permission only if they verify that the model properly captures the effects of margining when estimating EE. An institution that has not received such permission shall use one of the following Effective EPE measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective EPE, calculated without taking into account any collateral held or posted by way of margin plus any collateral that has been posted to the counterparty independent of the daily valuation and margining process or current exposure;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current exposure including all collateral currently held or posted, other than collateral called or in dispute;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the largest net exposure, including collateral under the margin agreement, that would not trigger a collateral call. This amount shall reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum transfer amounts, independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of point (b), institutions shall calculate the add-on as the expected positive change of the mark-to-market value of the transactions during the margin period of risk. Changes in the value of collateral shall be reflected using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach in accordance with Section 4 of Chapter 4 or the own estimates of volatility adjustments of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, but no collateral payments shall be assumed during the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk is subject to the minimum periods set out in paragraphs 2 to 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling the exposure value with margin agreements shall not be less than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 business days for netting sets consisting only of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions and margin lending transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 business days for all other netting sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 shall be subject to the following exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5000 at any point during a quarter, the margin period of risk for the following quarter shall not be less than 20 business days. This exception shall not apply to institutions&#x27; trade exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the margin period of risk shall not be less than 20 business days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;An institution shall determine whether collateral is illiquid or whether OTC derivatives cannot be easily replaced in the context of stressed market conditions, characterised by the absence of continuously active markets where a counterparty would, within two days or fewer, obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market discount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative).&lt;br&gt;An institution shall consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution would be able to replace those trades or securities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an institution has been involved in more than two margin call disputes on a particular netting set over the immediately preceding two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk under paragraphs 2 and 3, the institution shall use a margin period of risk that is at least double the period specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For re-margining with a periodicity of N days, the margin period of risk shall be at least equal to the period specified in paragraphs 2 and 3, F, plus N days minus one day. That is:Margin Period of Risk = F + N – 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the internal model includes the effect of margining on changes in the market value of the netting set, an institution shall model collateral, other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, jointly with the exposure in its exposure value calculations for OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure, it shall not recognise in its exposure value calculations for OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions the effect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, unless it uses either volatility adjustments that meet the standards of the financial collateral comprehensive Method with own volatility adjustments estimates or the standard Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach in accordance with Chapter 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution using the IMM shall ignore in its models the effect of a reduction of the exposure value due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it takes due account of settlement and pre-settlement credit risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it manages such risks as comprehensively as practicable at the counterparty level by aggregating CCR exposures with other credit exposures and at the firm-wide level.&lt;/li&gt;

Senior management shall be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the model used and the impact those limitations and assumptions can have on the reliability of the output through a formal process.

&lt;li&gt;The daily reports prepared on an institution&#x27;s exposures to CCR in accordance with Article 287(2)(b) shall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual credit managers or traders and reductions in the institution&#x27;s overall CCR exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution&#x27;s CCR management framework established in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be used in conjunction with internal credit and trading limits. Credit and trading limits shall be related to the institution&#x27;s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by credit managers, traders and senior management. An institution shall have a formal process to report breaches of risk limits to the appropriate level of management.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Senior management shall allocate sufficient resources to the collateral management unit required under paragraph 1(b) to ensure that its systems achieve an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of margin calls by the institution and the timeliness of the response of the institution to margin calls by its counterparties. Senior management shall ensure that the unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the institution to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that it has been using a model to calculate the distribution of exposures upon which the EPE calculation is based that meets, broadly, the requirements set out in this Section for at least one year prior to permission to use the IMM by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model used to generate a distribution of exposures to CCR shall be part of the CCR management framework required by Article 286. This framework shall include the measurement of usage of credit lines, aggregating CCR exposures with other credit exposures and internal capital allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to EPE, an institution shall measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution shall measure current exposure gross and net of collateral. The use test is satisfied if an institution uses other CCR measures, such as peak exposure, based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same model to compute EPE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall have the systems capability to estimate EE daily if necessary, unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authorities that its exposures to CCR warrant less frequent calculation. The institution shall estimate EE along a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts and in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure shall be measured, monitored and controlled over the life of all contracts in the netting set and not only to the one-year horizon. The institution shall have procedures in place to identify and control the risks for counterparties where the exposure rises beyond the one-year horizon. The forecast increase in exposure shall be an input into the institution&#x27;s internal capital model.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An institution shall have a comprehensive stress testing programme for CCR, including for use in assessment of own funds requirements for CCR, which complies with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shall identify possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on an institution&#x27;s credit exposures and assess the institution&#x27;s ability to withstand such changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stress measures under the programme shall be compared against risk limits and considered by the institution as part of the process set out in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The programme shall comprehensively capture trades and aggregate exposures across all forms of counterparty credit risk at the level of specific counterparties in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shall provide for at least monthly exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors such as interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices for all counterparties of the institution, in order to identify, and enable the institution when necessary to reduce outsized concentrations in specific directional risks. Exposure stress testing -including single factor, multifactor and material non-directional risks- and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness shall be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group and aggregate institution-wide CCR levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shall apply at least quarterly multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material non-directional risks including yield curve exposure and basis risks. Multiple-factor stress tests shall, at a minimum, address the following scenarios in which the following occurs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;severe economic or market events have occurred;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broad market liquidity has decreased significantly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a large financial intermediary is liquidating positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The severity of the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be sufficiently severe to capture historical extreme market environments and extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The stress tests shall evaluate the impact of such shocks on own funds, own funds requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations the testing programme shall also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The programme shall include provision, where appropriate, for reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes. Reverse stress testing shall account for the impact of material non-linearity in the portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The results of the stress testing under the programme shall be reported regularly, at least on a quarterly basis, to senior management. The reports and analysis of the results shall cover the largest counterparty-level impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior management shall take a lead role in the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the institution and ensure that the results are meaningful and used to manage CCR. The results of stress testing for significant exposures shall be assessed against guidelines that indicate the institution&#x27;s risk appetite, and referred to senior management for discussion and action when excessive or concentrated risks are identified.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Wrong-Way risk arises when the likelihood of default by counterparties is positively correlated with general market risk factors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific Wrong-Way risk arises when future exposure to a specific counterparty is positively correlated with the counterparty&#x27;s PD due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty. An institution shall be considered to be exposed to Specific Wrong-Way risk if the future exposure to a specific counterparty is expected to be high when the counterparty&#x27;s probability of a default is also high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall give due consideration to exposures that give rise to a significant degree of Specific and General Wrong-Way risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to identify General Wrong-Way risk, an institution shall design stress testing and scenario analyses to stress risk factors that are adversely related to counterparty creditworthiness. Such testing shall address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. An institution shall monitor General Wrong Way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are relevant to the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall maintain procedures to identify, monitor and control cases of Specific Wrong-Way risk for each legal entity, beginning at the inception of a transaction and continuing through the life of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for CCR in relation to transactions where Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified and where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the issuer of the underlying of the OTC derivative or the underlying of the transactions referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 273(2)), in accordance with the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instruments where Specific Wrong-Way risk exists shall not be included in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty, and shall each be treated as a separate netting set;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;within any such separate netting set, for single-name credit default swaps the exposure value equals the full expected loss in the value of the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments based on the assumption that the underlying issuer is in liquidation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LGD for an institution using the approach set out in Chapter 3 shall be 100 % for such swap transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for an institution using the approach set out in Chapter 2, the applicable risk weight shall be that of an unsecured transaction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for all other transactions referencing a single name in any such separate netting set, the calculation of the exposure value shall be consistent with the assumption of a jump-to-default of those underlying obligations where the issuer is legally connected with the counterparty. For transactions referencing a basket of names or index, the jump-to-default of the respective underlying obligations where the issuer is legally connected with the counterparty, shall be applied, if material;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the extent that this uses existing market risk calculations for own funds requirements for incremental default and migration risk as set out in Title IV, Chapter 5, Section 4 that already contain an LGD assumption, the LGD in the formula used shall be 100 %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall provide senior management and the appropriate committee of the management body with regular reports on both Specific and General Wrong-Way risks and the steps being taken to manage those risks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An institution shall ensure the integrity of modelling process as set out in Article 284 by adopting at least the following measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete, and conservative fashion;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those terms shall include at least contract notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, margining arrangements and netting arrangements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those terms and specifications shall be maintained in a database that is subject to formal and periodic audit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a process for recognising netting arrangements that requires legal staff to verify that netting under those arrangements is legally enforceable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the verification required under point (d) shall be entered into the database mentioned in point (c) by an independent unit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the transmission of transaction terms and specification data to the EPE model shall be subject to internal audit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there shall be processes for formal reconciliation between the model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current market data shall be used to determine current exposures. An institution may calibrate its EPE model using either historic market data or market implied data to establish parameters of the underlying stochastic processes, such as drift, volatility and correlation. If an institution uses historical data, it shall use at least three years of such data. The data shall be updated at least quarterly, and more frequently if necessary to reflect market conditions.&lt;br&gt;To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress calibration, an institution shall calibrate Effective EPE using either three years of data that includes a period of stress to the credit default spreads of its counterparties or market implied data from such a period of stress.&lt;br&gt;The requirements in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be applied by the institution for that purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority, at least quarterly, that the stress period used for the calculation under this paragraph coincides with a period of increased credit default swap or other credit (such as loan or corporate bond) spreads for a representative selection of its counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, it shall map that counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EPE model for all counterparties shall use data, either historic or implied, that include the data from the stressed credit period and shall use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the EPE model to current data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration for EEPE, an institution shall create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the main risk factors to which the institution is exposed. The exposure to these benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using (a) a stress methodology, based on current market values and model parameters calibrated to stressed market conditions, and (b) the exposure generated during the stress period, but applying the method set out in this Section (end of stress period market value, volatilities, and correlations from the 3-year stress period).&lt;br&gt;The competent authorities shall require an institution to adjust the stress calibration if the exposures of those benchmark portfolios deviate substantially from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An institution shall subject the model to a validation process that is clearly articulated in the institutions&#x27; policies and procedures. That validation process shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which the assumptions underlying the model are inappropriate and may therefore result in an understatement of EPE;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include a review of the comprehensiveness of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An institution shall monitor the relevant risks and have processes in place to adjust its estimation of Effective EPE when those risks become significant. In complying with this paragraph, the institution shall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify and manage its exposures to Specific Wrong-Way risk arising as specified in Article 291(1)(b) and exposures to General Wrong-Way risk arising as specified in Article 291(1)(a);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for exposures with a rising risk profile after one year, compare on a regular basis the estimate of a relevant measure of exposure over one year with the same exposure measure over the life of the exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for exposures with a residual maturity below one year, compare on a regular basis the replacement cost (current exposure) and the realised exposure profile, and store data that would allow such a comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall have internal procedures to verify that, prior to including a transaction in a netting set, the transaction is covered by a legally enforceable netting contract that meets the requirements set out in Section 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution that uses collateral to mitigate its CCR shall have internal procedures to verify that, prior to recognising the effect of collateral in its calculations, the collateral meets the legal certainty standards set out in Chapter 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines on the application of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the management body and senior management shall be involved in the risk control process and shall ensure that adequate resources are devoted to credit and counterparty credit risk control. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by the independent risk control unit established in accordance Article 287(1)(a) shall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the overall risk exposure of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal risk measurement exposure model shall be integrated into the day-to-day risk management process of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the risk measurement system shall be used in conjunction with internal trading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits shall be related to the institution&#x27;s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall ensure that its risk management system is well documented. In particular, it shall maintain a documented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system, and arrangements to ensure that those policies are complied with;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an independent review of the risk measurement system shall be carried out regularly in the institution&#x27;s own internal auditing process. This review shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management process shall take place at regular intervals (and no less than once a year) and shall specifically address, as a minimum, all items referred to in Article 288;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An institution shall document the process for initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and the calculation of the risk measures generated by the models to a level of detail that would enable a third party to recreate, respectively, the analysis and the risk measures. That documentation shall set out the frequency with which back testing analysis and any other on-going validation will be conducted, how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios and the analyses that are used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall define criteria with which to assess its CCR exposure models and the models that input into the calculation of exposure and maintain a written policy that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be identified and remedied.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and its risk measures, an institution shall ensure that the following requirements are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall carry out back-testing using historical data on movements in market risk factors prior to the permission by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1). That back-testing shall consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various initialisation dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution using the approach set out in Article 285(1)(b) shall regularly validate its model to test whether realised current exposures are consistent with prediction over all margin periods within one year. If some of the trades in the netting set have a maturity of less than one year, and the netting set has higher risk factor sensitivities without these trades, the validation shall take this into account;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall back-test the performance of its CCR exposure model and the model&#x27;s relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons considered shall include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collateralised or margined trading;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the model validation indicates that Effective EPE is underestimated, the institution shall take the action necessary to address the inaccuracy of the model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shall test the pricing models used to calculate CCR exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors as part of the initial and on-going model validation process. Pricing models for options shall account for the nonlinearity of option value with respect to market risk factors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CCR exposure model shall capture the transaction-specific information necessary to be able to aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. An institution shall verify that transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CCR exposure model shall include transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining. It shall take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model shall account for the nature of margin agreements that are unilateral or bilateral, the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the minimum threshold of un-margined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model shall either estimate the mark-to-market change in the value of collateral posted or apply the rules set out in Chapter 4;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model validation process shall include static, historical back-testing on representative counterparty portfolios. An institution shall conduct such back-testing on a number of representative counterparty portfolios that are actual or hypothetical at regular intervals. Those representative portfolios shall be chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to the material risk factors and combinations of risk factors to which the institution is exposed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall conduct back-testing that is designed to test the key assumptions of the CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures, including the modelled relationship between tenors of the same risk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the performance of CCR exposure models and its risk measures shall be subject to appropriate back-testing practice. The back testing programme shall be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model&#x27;s risk measures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall validate its CCR exposure models and all risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using IMM in accordance to the Article 283;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall regularly test the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the on-going model validation process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the on-going validation of an institution&#x27;s CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures shall include an assessment of the adequacy of the recent performance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the frequency with which the parameters of an CCR exposure model are updated shall be assessed by an institution as part of the initial and on-going validation process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the initial and on-going validation of CCR exposure models shall assess whether or not the counterparty level and netting set exposure calculations of exposure are appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate regulatory exposure value for every counterparty may be used in place of alpha multiplied by Effective EPE with the prior permission of the competent authorities. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial approval by the competent authorities and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE models. An institution shall validate the conservatism regularly. The on-going assessment of model performance shall cover all counterparties for which the models are used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If back-testing indicates that a model is not sufficiently accurate, the competent authorities shall revoke its permission for the model, or impose appropriate measures to ensure that the model is improved promptly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following conditions shall be fulfilled by all contractual netting agreements used by an institution for the purposes of determining exposure value in this Part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has concluded a contractual netting agreement with its counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that, in the event of default by the counterparty it would be entitled to receive or obliged to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has made available to the competent authorities written and reasoned legal opinions to the effect that, in the event of a legal challenge of the netting agreement, the institution&#x27;s claims and obligations would not exceed those referred to in point (a). The legal opinion shall refer to the applicable law:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a branch of an undertaking is involved, which is located in a country other than that where the undertaking is incorporated, the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the jurisdiction whose law governs the individual transactions included in the netting agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the jurisdiction whose law governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the contractual netting;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure across transactions with each counterparty. This aggregation shall be factored into credit limit purposes and internal capital purposes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contract shall not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor (i.e. walk-away clause).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;If any of the competent authorities are not satisfied that the contractual netting is legally valid and enforceable under the law of each of the jurisdictions referred to in point (b) the contractual netting agreement shall not be recognised as risk-reducing for either of the counterparties. Competent authorities shall inform each other accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal opinions referred to in point (b) may be drawn up by reference to types of contractual netting. The following additional conditions shall be fulfilled by contractual cross-product netting agreements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the net sum referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 is the net sum of the positive and negative close out values of any included individual bilateral master agreement and of the positive and negative mark-to-market value of the individual transactions (the cross-product net amount);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legal opinions referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 shall address the validity and enforceability of the entire contractual cross-product netting agreement under its terms and the impact of the netting arrangement on the material provisions of any included individual bilateral master agreement.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The institution shall maintain all required documentation relating to its contractual netting in its files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall factor the effects of netting into its measurement of each counterparty&#x27;s aggregate credit risk exposure and the institution shall manage its CCR on the basis of those effects of that measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of contractual cross-product netting agreements referred to in Article 295, the institution shall maintain procedures under Article 296(2)(c) to verify that any transaction which is to be included in a netting set is covered by a legal opinion referred to in Article 296(2)(b).&lt;br&gt;Taking into account the contractual cross-product netting agreement, the institution shall continue to comply with the requirements for the recognition of bilateral netting and the requirements of Chapter 4 for the recognition of credit risk mitigation, as applicable, with respect to each included individual bilateral master agreement and transaction.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;netting for the purposes of Sections 5 and 6 shall be recognised as set out in those Sections;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of contracts for novation, the single net amounts fixed by such contracts rather than the gross amounts involved, may be weighted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the application of Section 3, institutions may take the contract for novation into account when determining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current replacement cost referred to in Article 274(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the notional principal amounts or underlying values referred to in Article 274(2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the application of Section 4, in determining the notional amount referred to in Article 275(1) institutions may take into account the contract for novation for the purposes of calculating the notional principal amount In such cases, institutions shall apply the percentages of Table 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of other netting agreements, institutions shall apply Section 3 as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current replacement cost referred to in Article 274(1) for the contracts included in a netting agreement shall be obtained by taking account of the actual hypothetical net replacement cost which results from the agreement; in the case where netting leads to a net obligation for the institution calculating the net replacement cost, the current replacement cost is calculated as 0;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the figure for potential future credit exposure referred to in Article 274(2) for all contracts included in a netting agreement shall be reduced in accordance with the following formula:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#FORMULA#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;PCE &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; red &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; =the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts with a given counterparty included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;PCE &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; gross &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; =the sum of the figures for potential future credit exposure for all contracts with a given counterparty which are included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement and are calculated by multiplying their notional principal amounts by the percentages set out in Table 1;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;NGR&lt;/span&gt; =the net-to-gross ratio calculated as the quotient of the net replacement cost for all contracts included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement with a given counterparty (numerator) and the gross replacement cost for all contracts included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement with that counterparty (denominator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When carrying out the calculation of the potential future credit exposure in accordance with the formula set out in paragraph 1, institutions may treat perfectly matching contracts included in the netting agreement as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equivalent to the net receipts.&lt;br&gt;In the application of Article 275(1) institutions may treat perfectly matching contracts included in the netting agreement as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equivalent to the net receipts, and the notional principal amounts shall be multiplied by the percentages given in Table 3.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this paragraph, perfectly matching contracts are forward foreign-exchange contracts or similar contracts in which a notional principal is equivalent to cash flows if the cash flows fall due on the same value date and fully in the same currency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all other contracts included in a netting agreement, the percentages applicable may be reduced as indicated in Table 6:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty risk of items in the trading book, institutions shall comply with the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of total return swap credit derivatives and credit default swap credit derivatives, to obtain a figure for potential future credit exposure under the method set out in Section 3, the nominal amount of the instrument shall be multiplied by the following percentages:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 %, where the reference obligation is one that, if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution, would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 %, where the reference obligation is one that, if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution, would not be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of an institution whose exposure arising from a credit default swap represents a long position in the underlying, the percentage for potential future credit exposure may be 0 %, unless the credit default swap is subject to close-out upon the insolvency of the entity whose exposure arising from the swap represents a short position in the underlying, even though the underlying has not defaulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the credit derivative provides protection in relation to nth to default amongst a number of underlying obligations, an institution shall determine which of the percentage figures set out in the first subparagraph applies by reference to the obligation with the nth lowest credit quality which, if incurred by the institution, would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall not use the Financial Collateral Simple Method set out in Article 222 for the recognition of the effects of financial collateral;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions booked in the trading book, institutions may recognise as eligible collateral all financial instruments and commodities that are eligible to be included in the trading book;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for exposures arising from OTC derivative instruments booked in the trading book, institutions may recognise commodities that are eligible to be included in the trading book as eligible collateral;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the purposes of calculating volatility adjustments where such financial instruments or commodities which are not eligible under Chapter 4 are lent, sold or provided, or borrowed, purchased or received by way of collateral or otherwise under such a transaction, and an institution is using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach under Section 3 of Chapter 4, institutions shall treat such instruments and commodities in the same way as non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where an institution is using the Own Estimates of Volatility adjustments Approach under Section 3 of Chapter 4 in respect of financial instruments or commodities which are not eligible under Chapter 4, it shall calculate volatility adjustments for each individual item. Where an institution has obtained the approval to use the internal models approach defined in Chapter 4, it may also apply that approach in the trading book;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in relation to the recognition of master netting agreements covering repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, or other capital market-driven transactions, institutions shall only recognise netting across positions in the trading book and the non-trading book when the netted transactions fulfil the following conditions:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the positions and assets of that institution related to those transactions are distinguished and segregated, at the level of both the clearing member and the CCP, from the positions and assets of both the clearing member and the other clients of that clearing member and as a result of that distinction and segregation those positions and assets are bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of the clearing member or one or more of its other clients;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;laws, regulations, rules and contractual arrangements applicable to or binding that institution or the CCP facilitate the transfer of the client&#x27;s positions relating to those contracts and transactions and of the corresponding collateral to another clearing member within the applicable margin period of risk in the event of default or insolvency of the original clearing member. In such circumstance, the client&#x27;s positions and the collateral shall be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution has available an independent, written and reasoned legal opinion that concludes that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that the client would bear no losses on account of the insolvency of its clearing member or of any of its clearing member&#x27;s clients under the laws of the jurisdiction of the institution, its clearing member and the CCP, the law governing the transactions and contracts the institution clears through the CCP, the law governing the collateral, and the law governing any contract or agreement necessary to meet the condition in point (b);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where assets posted as collateral to a CCP or a clearing member are bankruptcy remote in the event that the CCP, the clearing member or one or more of the other clients of the clearing member becomes insolvent, an institution may attribute an exposure value of zero to the counterparty credit risk exposures for those assets.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;institutions shall map all activities into the business lines in a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall allocate any activity which cannot be readily mapped into the business line framework, but which represents an ancillary activity to an activity included in the framework, to the business line it supports. Where more than one business line is supported through the ancillary activity, institutions shall use an objective-mapping criterion;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where an activity cannot be mapped into a particular business line then institutions shall use the business line yielding the highest percentage. The same business line equally applies to any ancillary activity associated with that activity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions may use internal pricing methods to allocate the relevant indicator between business lines. Costs generated in one business line which are imputable to a different business line may be reallocated to the business line to which they pertain;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes shall be consistent with the categories institutions use for credit and market risks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;senior management shall be responsible for the mapping policy under the control of the management body of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the relevant indicator is a normalised income indicator equal to the nominal amount of loans and advances multiplied by 0,035;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the loans and advances consist of the total drawn amounts in the corresponding credit portfolios. For the commercial banking business line, institutions shall also include securities held in the non trading book in the nominal amount of loans and advances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standards relating to process are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall calculate its own funds requirement as comprising both expected loss and unexpected loss, unless expected loss is adequately captured in its internal business practices. The operational risk measure shall capture potentially severe tail events, achieving a soundness standard comparable to a 99,9 % confidence interval over a one year period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s operational risk measurement system shall include the use of internal data, external data, scenario analysis and factors reflecting the business environment and internal control systems as set out in paragraphs 3 to 6. An institution shall have in place a well documented approach for weighting the use of these four elements in its overall operational risk measurement system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s risk measurement system shall capture the major drivers of risk affecting the shape of the tail of the estimated distribution of losses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution may recognise correlations in operational risk losses across individual operational risk estimates only where its systems for measuring correlations are sound, implemented with integrity, and take into account the uncertainty surrounding any such correlation estimates, particularly in periods of stress. An institution shall validate its correlation assumptions using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s risk measurement system shall be internally consistent and shall avoid the multiple counting of qualitative assessments or risk mitigation techniques recognised in other areas of this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standards relating to internal data are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall base its internally generated operational risk measures on a minimum historical observation period of five years. When an institution first moves to an Advanced Measurement Approach, it may use a three-year historical observation period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall be able to map their historical internal loss data into the business lines defined in Article 317 and into the event types defined in Article 324, and to provide these data to competent authorities upon request. In exceptional circumstances, an institution may allocate loss events which affect the entire institution to an additional business line corporate items. An institution shall have in place documented, objective criteria for allocating losses to the specified business lines and event types. An institution shall record the operational risk losses that are related to credit risk and that the institution has historically included in the internal credit risk databases in the operational risk databases and shall identify them separately. Such losses shall not be subject to the operational risk charge, provided that the institution is required to continue to treat them as credit risk for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements. An institution shall include operational risk losses that are related to market risks in the scope of the own funds requirement for operational risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s internal loss data shall be comprehensive in that it captures all material activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and geographic locations. An institution shall be able to justify that any excluded activities or exposures, both individually and in combination, would not have a material impact on the overall risk estimates. An institution shall define appropriate minimum loss thresholds for internal loss data collection;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aside from information on gross loss amounts, an institution shall collect information about the date of the loss event, any recoveries of gross loss amounts, as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss event;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall have in place specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from a loss event in a centralised function or an activity that spans more than one business line, as well as from related loss events over time;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall have in place documented procedures for assessing the on-going relevance of historical loss data, including those situations in which judgement overrides, scaling, or other adjustments may be used, to what extent they may be used and who is authorised to make such decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualifying standards relating to external data are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s operational risk measurement system shall use relevant external data, especially when there is reason to believe that the institution is exposed to infrequent, yet potentially severe, losses. An institution shall have a systematic process for determining the situations for which external data shall be used and the methodologies used to incorporate the data in its measurement system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall regularly review the conditions and practices for external data and shall document them and subject them to periodic independent review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to high severity events. Over time, the institution shall validate and reassess such assessments through comparison to actual loss experience to ensure their reasonableness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualifying standards relating to business environment and internal control factors are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution&#x27;s firm-wide risk assessment methodology shall capture key business environment and internal control factors that can change the institutions operational risk profile;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall justify the choice of each factor as a meaningful driver of risk, based on experience and involving the expert judgment of the affected business areas;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall be able to justify to competent authorities the sensitivity of risk estimates to changes in the factors and the relative weighting of the various factors. In addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls, an institution&#x27;s risk measurement framework shall also capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased business volume;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall document its risk measurement framework and shall subject it to independent review within the institution and by competent authorities. Over time, an institution shall validate and reassess the process and the outcomes through comparison to actual internal loss experience and relevant external data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The competent authorities shall permit institutions to recognise the impact of insurance subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 and other risk transfer mechanisms where the institution can demonstrate that a noticeable risk mitigating effect is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The insurance provider shall be authorised to provide insurance or re-insurance and shall have a minimum claims paying ability rating by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions under Title II, Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the insurance policy has an initial term of no less than one year. For policies with a residual term of less than one year, an institution shall make appropriate haircuts reflecting the declining residual term of the policy, up to a full 100 % haircut for policies with a residual term of 90 days or less;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the insurance policy has a minimum notice period for cancellation of the contract of 90 days;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the insurance policy has no exclusions or limitations triggered by supervisory actions or, in the case of a failed institution, that preclude the institution&#x27;s receiver or liquidator from recovering the damages suffered or expenses incurred by the institution, except in respect of events occurring after the initiation of receivership or liquidation proceedings in respect of the institution. However, the insurance policy may exclude any fine, penalty, or punitive damages resulting from actions by the competent authorities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the risk mitigation calculations shall reflect the insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the overall determination of operational risk capital;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the insurance is provided by a third party entity. In the case of insurance through captives and affiliates, the exposure has to be laid off to an independent third party entity that meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraph 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the framework for recognising insurance is well reasoned and documented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for market risk under the sensitivities-based method by aggregating the following three own funds requirements in accordance with Article 325h:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;own funds requirements for delta risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its non-volatility related risk factors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;own funds requirements for vega risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its volatility-related risk factors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;own funds requirements for curvature risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in the main non-volatility related risk factors not captured by the own funds requirements for delta risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all the positions of instruments with optionality shall be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all the positions of instruments without optionality shall only be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments with optionality include, among others: calls, puts, caps, floors, swap options, barrier options and exotic options. Embedded options, such as prepayment or behavioural options, shall be considered to be stand-alone positions in options for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk.&lt;br&gt;For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of the underlying&#x27;s notional amount shall be considered to be instruments without optionality.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in Subsection 1 of Section 3 to calculate the own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall apply the process set out in paragraphs 3 to 8 to calculate own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each risk class, the sensitivity of all instruments in scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risks to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulas in Subsection 2 of Section 3. If the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitivities shall be assigned to one of the buckets b within each risk class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within each bucket b, the positive and negative sensitivities to the same risk factor shall be netted, giving rise to net sensitivities (s &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; k &lt;/span&gt; ) to each risk factor k within a bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net sensitivities to each risk factor within each bucket shall be multiplied by the corresponding risk weights set out in Section 6, giving rise to weighted sensitivities to each risk factor within that bucket in accordance with the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrListNoStyle&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weighted sensitivities to the different risk factors within each bucket shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, where the quantity within the square root function is floored at zero, giving rise to the bucket-specific sensitivity. The corresponding correlations for weighted sensitivities within the same bucket (ρ &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; kl &lt;/span&gt; ), set out in Section 6, shall be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bucket-specific sensitivity shall be calculated for each bucket within a risk class in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7. Once the bucket-specific sensitivity has been calculated for all buckets, weighted sensitivities to all risk factors across buckets shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, using the corresponding correlations γbc for weighted sensitivities in different buckets set out in Section 6, giving rise to the risk-class specific own funds requirement for delta or vega risk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For all general interest rate risk factors, including inflation risk and cross-currency basis risk, there shall be one bucket per currency, each containing different types of risk factor.&lt;br&gt;The delta general interest rate risk factors applicable to interest rate-sensitive instruments shall be the relevant risk-free rates per currency and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall assign risk factors to the specified vertices by linear interpolation or by using a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the independent risk control function of the institution to report market risk or profits and losses to senior management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall obtain the risk-free rates per currency from money market instruments held in the trading book of the institution that have the lowest credit risk, such as overnight index swaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where institutions cannot apply the approach referred to in paragraph 2, the risk-free rates shall be based on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark positions to market, such as the interbank offered rate swap curves.&lt;br&gt;Where the data on market-implied swap curves described in paragraph 2 and the first subparagraph of this paragraph are insufficient, the risk-free rates may be derived from the most appropriate sovereign bond curve for a given currency.&lt;br&gt;Where institutions use the general interest rate risk factors derived in accordance with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph for sovereign debt instruments, the sovereign debt instrument shall not be exempted from the own funds requirements for credit spread risk. In those cases, where it is not possible to disentangle the risk-free rate from the credit spread component, the sensitivity to the risk factor shall be allocated both to the general interest rate risk and to credit spread risk classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of general interest rate risk factors, each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Institutions shall assign risk factors within the same bucket, but with different maturities, a different risk weight, in accordance with Section 6.&lt;br&gt;Institutions shall apply additional risk factors for inflation risk to debt instruments whose cash flows are functionally dependent on inflation rates. Those additional risk factors shall consist of one vector of market-implied inflation rates of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are inflation rates used as variables by the institution&#x27;s pricing model for that instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the additional risk factor for inflation risk referred to in paragraph 4 as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket, institutions shall treat inflation as a single risk factor, regardless of the number of components of each vector. Institutions shall offset all sensitivities to inflation within a bucket, calculated as described in this paragraph, in order to give rise to a single net sensitivity per bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt instruments that involve payments in different currencies shall also be subject to cross-currency basis risk between those currencies. For the purposes of the sensitivities-based method, the risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be the cross-currency basis risk of each currency over either US dollar or euro. Institutions shall compute cross currency bases that do not relate to either basis over US dollar or basis over euro either on basis over US dollar or basis over euro.&lt;br&gt;Each cross-currency basis risk factor shall consist of one vector of cross-currency basis of different maturities per currency. For each debt instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are cross-currency bases used as variables by the institution&#x27;s pricing model for that instrument. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket.&lt;br&gt;Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the cross-currency basis risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket there shall be two possible distinct risk factors: basis over euro and basis over US dollar, regardless of the number of components there are in each cross-currency basis vector. The maximum number of net sensitivities per bucket shall be two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vega general interest rate risk factors applicable to options with underlyings that are sensitive to general interest rate shall be the implied volatilities of the relevant risk-free rates as described in paragraphs 2 and 3, which shall be assigned to buckets depending on the currency and mapped to the following maturities within each bucket: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be one bucket per currency.&lt;br&gt;For netting purposes, institutions shall consider implied volatilities linked to the same risk-free rates and mapped to the same maturities to constitute the same risk factor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where institutions map implied volatilities to the maturities as referred to in this paragraph, the following requirements shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the maturity of the option is aligned with the maturity of the underlying, a single risk factor shall be considered, which shall be mapped to that maturity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the maturity of the option is shorter than the maturity of the underlying, the following risk factors shall be considered as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first risk factor shall be mapped to the maturity of the option;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the second risk factor shall be mapped to the residual maturity of the underlying of the option at the expiry date of the option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The curvature general interest rate risk factors to be applied by institutions shall consist of one vector of risk-free rates, representing a specific risk-free yield curve, per currency. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of risk-free rates used as variables by the institution&#x27;s pricing model for that instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors corresponding to different yield curves and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same currency. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the same risk factor. There shall be only one net sensitivity per bucket.&lt;br&gt;There shall be no curvature risk own funds requirements for inflation and cross currency basis risks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short exposure means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a gain for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long exposure means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a loss for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gross jump-to-default (gross JTD) amount means the estimated size of the loss or gain that the default of the obligor would produce for a specific exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net jump-to-default (net JTD) amount means the estimated size of the loss or gain that an institution would incur due to the default of an obligor, after offsetting between gross JTD amounts has taken place,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loss given default or LGD means the loss given default of the obligor on an instrument issued by that obligor expressed as a share of the notional amount of the instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;default risk weight means the percentage representing the estimated probability of the default of each obligor, according to the creditworthiness of that obligor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own funds requirements for the default risk shall apply to debt and equity instruments, to derivative instruments having those instruments as underlyings and to derivatives, the pay-offs or fair values of which are affected by the default of an obligor other than the counterparty to the derivative instrument itself. Institutions shall calculate default risk requirements separately for each of the following types of instruments: non-securitisations, securitisations that are not included in the ACTP, and securitisations that are included in the ACTP. The final own funds requirements for the default risk to be applied by institutions shall be the sum of those three components.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exposures to non-senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 100 %;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the calculations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, notional amounts shall be determined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of debt instruments, the notional amount is the face value of the debt instrument;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the case of derivative instruments with debt security underlyings, the notional amount is the notional amount of the derivative instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;decomposition with a valuation model means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with an LGD of 100 %;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replication means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decomposition means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;for indices, index tranches and bespoke tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche, subject to the provisions on exposures of less than one year laid down in Article 325x; long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts that perfectly replicate each other may be offset through decomposition into single name equivalent exposures using a valuation model; in such cases, the sum of the gross JTD amounts of the single name equivalent exposures obtained through decomposition shall be equal to the gross JTD amount of the undecomposed exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offsetting through decomposition as set out is point (a) shall not be allowed for resecuritisations or derivatives on securitisation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for indices and index tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche by replication or by decomposition; where the long exposures and short exposures are otherwise equivalent, apart from one residual component, offsetting shall be allowed and the net JTD amount shall reflect the residual exposure;&lt;/li&gt;

For the portfolio referred to in paragraph 5, that add-on shall be calculated on the basis of the number of overshootings that occurred over the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution&#x27;s back-testing of the value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph. The calculation of the add-on shall be subject to the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

To do so, the institution shall demonstrate to its competent authority that the stress scenario risk measure calculated in accordance with Article 325bk for that non-modellable risk factor is higher than the positive difference between the change in the value of the institution&#x27;s portfolio and the related value-at-risk number.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions using an internal risk-measurement model that is used to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk as referred to in Article 325ba shall ensure that that model meets all the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, which shall include at least the risk factors referred to in Subsection 1 of Section 3 of Chapter 1a unless the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the omission of those risk factors does not have a material impact on the results of the P&amp;amp;L attribution requirement referred to in Article 325bg; an institution shall be able to explain to the competent authorities why it has incorporated a risk factor in its pricing model but not in its internal risk-measurement model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal risk-measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate a set of risk factors that correspond to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance-sheet positions; the institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches; the yield curve shall be divided into various maturity segments to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve; for material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be modelled using a minimum of six maturity segments, and the number of risk factors used to model the yield curve shall be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the institution&#x27;s trading strategies, the model shall also capture the risk spread of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves or different financial instruments on the same underlying issuer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution&#x27;s positions are denominated; for CIUs, the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account; institutions may rely on third-party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, provided that the correctness of that report is adequately ensured; foreign exchange positions of a CIU of which an institution is not aware of shall be carved out from the internal models approach and treated in accordance with Chapter 1a;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sophistication of the modelling technique shall be proportionate to the materiality of the institutions&#x27; activities in the equity markets; the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions and at least one risk factor that captures systemic movements in equity prices and the dependency of that risk factor on the individual risk factors for each equity market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions, unless the institution has a small aggregate commodity position compared to all its trading activities, in which case it may use a separate risk factor for each broad commodity type; for material exposures to commodity markets, the model shall capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between commodities that are similar, but not identical, the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches, and the convenience yield between derivative and cash positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the proxies used shall show a good track record for the actual position held, shall be appropriately conservative, and shall be used only where the available data are insufficient, such as during the period of stress referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(2);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for material exposures to volatility risks in instruments with optionality, the internal risk-measurement model shall capture the dependency of implied volatilities across strike prices and options&#x27; maturities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any internal risk-measurement model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk management process of the institution and shall serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and that reports directly to senior management; that unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal risk-measurement model; that unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be responsible for the overall risk management system; that unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk, as well as reports on the appropriateness of measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process, and the daily reports produced by the risk control unit shall be reviewed at a level of management with sufficient authority to require the reduction of positions taken by individual traders and to require the reduction of the institution&#x27;s overall risk exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to the sophistication of the internal risk-measurement models, and a sufficient number of staff with skills in the trading, risk control, audit and back-office areas;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have in place a documented set of internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the overall operation of its internal risk-measurement models;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any internal risk-measurement model, including any pricing model, shall have a proven track record of being reasonably accurate in measuring risks, and shall not differ significantly from the models that the institution uses for its internal risk management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall frequently conduct rigorous programmes of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which shall encompass any internal risk-measurement model; the results of those stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management at least on a monthly basis and shall comply with the policies and limits approved by the management body; the institution shall take appropriate actions where the results of those stress tests show excessive losses arising from the trading&#x27;s business of the institution under certain circumstances;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall conduct an independent review of its internal risk-measurement models, either as part of its regular internal auditing process, or by mandating a third-party undertaking to conduct that review, which shall be conducted to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and the independent risk control unit. The institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk management process at least once a year. That review shall assess the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the processes the institution employs for approving the risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scope of risks captured by the model, the accuracy and appropriateness of the risk-measurement system, and the validation of any significant changes to the internal risk-measurement model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations, and the accuracy and appropriateness for generating data proxies where the available data are insufficient to meet the requirement set out in this Chapter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of the data sources used to run any of its internal risk-measurement models, including the independence of those data sources;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate back-testing requirements and P&amp;amp;L attribution requirements that are conducted in order to assess the accuracy of its internal risk-measurement models;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the review is performed by a third-party undertaking in accordance with point (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the verification that the internal validation process set out in Article 325bj fulfils its objectives.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In their internal default risk models, institutions may only recognise hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers by explicitly modelling the gross long and short positions in the different instruments, including modelling of basis risks between different issuers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In their internal default risk models, institutions shall capture material risks between a hedging instrument and the hedged instrument that could occur during the interval between the maturity of a hedging instrument and the one-year time horizon, as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies that arise from differences in the type of product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external ratings, maturity, vintage and other differences. Institutions shall recognise a hedging instrument only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit event or other event.&lt;/li&gt;

For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using two types of systematic risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependency between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products.&lt;/li&gt;

Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of this Article, long position means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and short position means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities.

Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the protection seller), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller&#x27;s perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a first-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;A -n-th-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less the n-1 reference entities with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.&lt;br&gt;Where an n-th-to-default credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the party who transfers credit risk (the protection buyer), the positions are determined as the mirror principle of the protection seller, with the exception of a credit linked note (which entails no short position in the issuer). When calculating the own funds requirement for the protection buyer, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller&#x27;s perspective carrying a negative sign. If at a given moment there is a call option in combination with a step-up, such moment is treated as the maturity of the protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit derivatives in accordance with Article 338(1) or (3) shall be included only in the determination of the specific risk own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338(4).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In order to calculate own funds requirements against general risk all positions shall be weighted according to maturity as explained in paragraph 2 in order to compute the amount of own funds required against them. This requirement shall be reduced when a weighted position is held alongside an opposite weighted position within the same maturity band. A reduction in the requirement shall also be made when the opposite weighted positions fall into different maturity bands, with the size of this reduction depending both on whether the two positions fall into the same zone, or not, and on the particular zones they fall into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall assign its net positions to the appropriate maturity bands in column 2 or 3, as appropriate, in Table 2 in paragraph 4. It shall do so on the basis of residual maturity in the case of fixed-rate instruments and on the basis of the period until the interest rate is next set in the case of instruments on which the interest rate is variable before final maturity. It shall also distinguish between debt instruments with a coupon of 3 % or more and those with a coupon of less than 3 % and thus allocate them to column 2 or column 3 in Table 2. It shall then multiply each of them by the weighing for the maturity band in question in column 4 in Table 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall then work out the sum of the weighted long positions and the sum of the weighted short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched weighted position in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched weighted position for the same band. The total of the matched weighted positions in all bands shall then be calculated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institution shall compute the totals of the unmatched weighted long positions for the bands included in each of the zones in Table 2 in order to derive the unmatched weighted long position for each zone. Similarly, the sum of the unmatched weighted short positions for each band in a particular zone shall be summed to compute the unmatched weighted short position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long position for a given zone that is matched by the unmatched weighted short position for the same zone shall be the matched weighted position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long or unmatched weighted short position for a zone that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched weighted position for that zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Institutions may use an approach for calculating the own funds requirement for the general risk on debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the approach set out in Article 339, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the duration-based approach referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall take the market value of each fixed-rate debt instrument and hence calculate its yield to maturity, which is implied discount rate for that instrument. In the case of floating-rate instruments, the institution shall take the market value of each instrument and hence calculate its yield on the assumption that the principal is due when the interest rate can next be changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#FORMULA#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt; =duration calculated according to the following formula:#FORMULA#where:Ryield to maturity;C &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; t &lt;/span&gt; cash payment in time t;Mtotal maturity.&lt;/p&gt;Correction shall be made to the calculation of the modified duration for debt instruments which are subject to prepayment risk. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines about how to apply such corrections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institution shall then allocate each debt instrument to the appropriate zone in Table 3. It shall do so on the basis of the modified duration of each instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The institution shall then calculate the duration-weighted position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed interest-rate change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The institution shall calculate its duration-weighted long and its duration-weighted short positions within each zone. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter within each zone shall be the matched duration-weighted position for that zone.&lt;br&gt;The institution shall then calculate the unmatched duration-weighted positions for each zone. It shall then follow the procedures laid down for unmatched weighted positions in Article 339(5) to (8).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institution&#x27;s own funds requirement shall then be calculated as the sum of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An 80 % offset will be applied when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and where there is an exact match in terms of the reference obligation, the maturity of both the reference obligation and the credit derivative, and the currency of the underlying exposure. In addition, key features of the credit derivative contract shall not cause the price movement of the credit derivative to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80 % specific risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction with the higher own funds requirement, while the specific risk requirements on the other side shall be zero.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the reference obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying obligation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the underlying obligation and reference obligation share the same obligor and have legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the position falls under paragraph 3(a) or paragraph 4 but there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying asset. Such currency mismatch shall be included in the own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the position falls under paragraph 4 but there is an asset mismatch between the cash position and the credit derivative. However, the underlying asset is included in the (deliverable) obligations in the credit derivative documentation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk. Under such an approach, positions in CIUs shall be treated as positions in the underlying investments of the CIU. Netting shall be permitted between positions in the underlying investments of the CIU and other positions held by the institution, provided that the institution holds a sufficient quantity of shares or units to allow for redemption/creation in exchange for the underlying investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, for positions in CIUs by assuming positions representing those necessary to replicate the composition and performance of the externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities referred to in point (a), subject to the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purpose of the CIU&#x27;s mandate is to replicate the composition and performance of an externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a minimum correlation coefficient between daily returns on the CIU and the index or basket of equities or debt securities it tracks of 0,9 can be clearly established over a minimum period of six months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level.&lt;/li&gt;

For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option&#x27;s or warrant&#x27;s value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.&lt;br&gt;The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently.&lt;br&gt;The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies in accordance with the quotas in force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An institution may use the net present value when calculating the net open position in each currency and in gold provided that the institution applies this approach consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net short and long positions in each currency other than the reporting currency and the net long or short position in gold shall be converted at spot rates into the reporting currency. They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively.

This shall be done by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the investment mandate. The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the addition of the total long position to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position to the total short open foreign exchange position where the direction of the CIU&#x27;s investment is available.

&lt;li&gt;the model shall capture accurately all material price risks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, depending on the level of activity of the institution in the respective markets. Where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution&#x27;s pricing model but not into the risk-measurement model, the institution shall be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent authority.

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution&#x27;s positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution&#x27;s internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk-management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and reports directly to senior management. The unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, being responsible for the overall risk management system. The unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used for calculating capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk and commodities risk, and on the appropriate measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution&#x27;s management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institution&#x27;s overall risk exposure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter, in the trading, risk-control, audit and back-office areas;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall frequently conduct a rigorous programme of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which encompasses any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter and the results of these stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it sets. This process shall particularly address illiquidity of markets in stressed market conditions, concentration risk, one way markets, event and jump-to-default risks, non-linearity of products, deep out-of-the-money positions, positions subject to the gapping of prices and other risks that may not be captured appropriately in the internal models. The shocks applied shall reflect the nature of the portfolios and the time it could take to hedge out or manage risks under severe market conditions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution shall conduct, as part of its regular internal auditing process, an independent review of its internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk-control unit. At least once a year, the institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk-management process. The review shall consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the adequacy of the documentation of the risk-management system and process and the organisation of the risk-control unit;&lt;/li&gt;

The validation shall be conducted when the internal model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the internal model. The validation shall also be conducted on a periodic basis but especially where there have been any significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal model no longer being adequate.

&lt;li&gt;Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected.&lt;/li&gt;

When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions.

Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments. Institutions shall reflect the impact of material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge&#x27;s maturity and the liquidity horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instruments.

&lt;li&gt;With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution&#x27;s own funds requirement in accordance with this Article.

&lt;/ol&gt;Applying this approach shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole or form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the statements and disclosures made by the originators or sponsors, or their agents or advisors, about their due diligence on the securitised exposures and, where applicable, on the quality of the collateral supporting the securitised exposures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where applicable, the methodologies and concepts on which the valuation of collateral supporting the securitised exposures is based and the policies adopted by the originator or sponsor to ensure the independence of the valuer;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;Institutions shall regularly perform their own stress tests appropriate to their securitisation positions. To this end, institutions may rely on financial models developed by an ECAI provided that institutions can demonstrate, when requested, that they took due care prior to investing to validate the relevant assumptions in and structuring of the models and to understand methodology, assumptions and results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions, other than when acting as originators or sponsors or original lenders, shall establish formal procedures appropriate to their trading book and non-trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner performance information on the exposures underlying their securitisation positions. Where relevant, this shall include the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, collateral type and occupancy, and frequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and geographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with band widths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Where the underlying exposures are themselves securitisation positions, institutions shall have the information set out in this subparagraph not only on the underlying securitisation tranches, such as the issuer name and credit quality, but also on the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying those securitisation tranches.&lt;br&gt;Institutions shall also apply the same standards of analysis to participations or underwritings in securitisation issues purchased from third parties whether such participations or underwritings are to be held on their trading or non-trading book.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;they are appropriately diversified. Diversification is not required in terms of assets corresponding to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 416(1) which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question, unless the institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that it has appropriately hedged the ensuing currency risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a portion of the liquid assets except those referred to in points (a), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 416(1) is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or via simple repurchase agreements on an approved repurchase market for the following purposes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to test the access to the market for these assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liquidation of assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to test the usability of the assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they are readily available to the treasury when needed and especially that they are not used in other ongoing operations, including:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hedging or other trading strategies;&lt;/li&gt;

The haircuts shall not be less than 15 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1). If the institution hedges the price risk associated with an asset, it shall take into account the cash flow resulting from the potential close-out of the hedge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares or units in CIUs as referred to in Article 416(6) shall be subject to haircuts, looking through to the underlying assets as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 % for the assets referred to in point (a) of Article 416(1);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;20 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look-through approach referred to in paragraph 2 shall be applied as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to assign them to points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in descending order in the asset types referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1) until the maximum total investment limit is reached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall develop robust methodologies and processes to calculate and report the market value and haircuts for shares or units in CIUs. Only where they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the materiality of the exposure does not justify the development of their own methodologies, institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report the haircuts for shares or units in CIUs, in accordance with the methods set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants.&lt;/li&gt;

These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.&lt;br&gt;For this assessment, institutions shall take particular account of material reputational damage that could result from not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Institutions shall report not less than annually to the competent authorities those products and services for which the likelihood and potential volume of the liquidity outflows referred to in the first subparagraph are material and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned. The competent authorities may apply an outflow rate up to 5 % for trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and Annex I.&lt;br&gt;The competent authorities shall at least annually report to EBA the types of products or services for which they have determined outflows on the basis of the reports from institutions.

&lt;li&gt;assets with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow provided that the contract allows the bank to withdraw and request payment within 30 days;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 if they are collateralised by liquid assets as referred to in Article 416(1), shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monies due that the institution owing those monies treats in accordance with Article 422(3) and (4), shall be multiplied by a corresponding symmetrical inflow;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monies due from positions in major index equity instruments provided that there is no double counting with liquid assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100 % in the event of a net inflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of derogation from point (g) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under a combined market and idiosyncratic stress of the provider;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counterparty is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC or a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation or the central institution or a member of a network that is subject to the waiver referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a corresponding symmetric or more conservative outflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Articles 422, 423 and 424;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 4 where Article 20(1)(b) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such higher inflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in Article 20(1)(b). Fulfilment of the conditions for such higher inflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 5.&lt;br&gt;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015.&lt;br&gt;Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall not report inflows from any of the liquid assets reported in accordance with Article 416 other than payments due on the assets that are not reflected in the market value of the asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall not report inflows from any new obligations entered into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall take liquidity inflows which are to be received in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies into account only to the extent that they correspond to outflows respectively in the third country or currency in question.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of paragraph 2, the capital measure shall be the Tier 1 capital.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions shall determine the exposure value of assets, excluding contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, in accordance with the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exposure values of assets means exposure values in accordance with the first sentence of Article 111(1);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce exposure values of assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loans shall not be netted with deposits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions shall not be netted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions may deduct from the exposure measure set out in paragraph 4 of this Article the amounts deducted from Common equity Tier 1 capital in accordance with Article 36(1)(d).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities may permit an institution not to include in the exposure measure exposures that can benefit from the treatment laid down in Article 113(6). Competent authorities may grant that permission only where all the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) of Article 113(6) are met and where they have given the approval laid down in Article 113(6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of derogation from point (d) of paragraph 5, institutions may determine the exposure value of cash receivables and cash payables of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis only if all the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in all the following situations:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the normal course of business;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the event of default, insolvency and bankruptcy;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or the transactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph, a settlement mechanism results in the functional equivalent of net settlement if, on the settlement date, the net result of the cash flows of the transactions under that mechanism is equal to the single net amount under net settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall determine the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives including those that are off-balance sheet, in accordance with Article 429a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall determine the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items, excluding contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions, in accordance with Article 111(1). However, institutions shall not reduce the nominal value of those items by specific credit risk adjustments.&lt;br&gt;In accordance with Article 166(9), where a commitment refers to the extension of another commitment, the lower of the two conversion factors associated with the individual commitment shall be used. The exposure value of low risk off- balance sheet items referred to in Article 111(1)(d) shall be subject to a floor equal to 10 % of their nominal value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An institution that is a clearing member of a QCCP may exclude from the calculation of the exposure measure trade exposures of the following items, provided that those trade exposures are cleared with that QCCP and meet, at the same time, the conditions laid down in Article 306(1)(c):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracts listed in Annex II;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;long settlement transactions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margin lending transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where an institution that is a clearing member of a QCCP guarantees to the QCCP the performance of a client that enters directly into derivative transactions with the QCCP, it shall include in the exposure measure the exposure resulting from the guarantee as a derivative exposure to the client in accordance with Article 429a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where national generally accepted accounting principles recognise fiduciary assets on balance sheet, in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 86/635/EEC, those assets may be excluded from the leverage ratio total exposure measure provided that they meet the criteria for non-recognition set out in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, and, where applicable, the criteria for non-consolidation set out in International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 10, as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competent authorities may permit an institution to exclude from the exposure measure exposures that meet all of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are exposures to a public sector entity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are treated in accordance with Article 116(4);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they arise from deposits that the institution is legally obliged to transfer to the public sector entity referred to in point (a) for the purposes of funding general interest investments.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall determine the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, including those that are off-balance sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Article 274. Institutions shall apply Article 299(2)(a) for the determination of the potential future credit exposure for credit derivatives.&lt;br&gt;When determining the potential future credit exposure of credit derivatives, institutions shall apply the principles laid down in Article 299(2)(a) to all their credit derivatives, not only those assigned to the trading book.&lt;br&gt;In determining the exposure value, institutions may take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements in accordance with Article 295. Cross-product netting shall not apply. However, institutions may net within the product category referred to in point (25)(c) of Article 272 and credit derivatives when they are subject to a contractual cross-product netting agreement referred to in Article 295(c).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the provision of collateral related to derivatives contracts reduces the amount of assets under the applicable accounting framework, institutions shall reverse that reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of paragraph 1, institutions may deduct variation margin received in cash from the counterparty from the current replacement cost portion of the exposure value in so far as under the applicable accounting framework the variation margin has not already been recognised as a reduction of the exposure value and when all the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for trades not cleared through a QCCP, the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the variation margin is calculated and exchanged on a daily basis based on mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the variation margin received in cash is in the same currency as the currency of settlement of the derivative contract;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the variation margin exchanged is the full amount that would be necessary to fully extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the derivative contract and the variation margin between the institution and the counterparty to that contract are covered by a single netting agreement that the institution may treat as risk-reducing in accordance with Article 295.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;For the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph, where the derivative contract is subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the currency of settlement means any currency of settlement specified in the derivative contract, the governing qualifying master netting agreement or the credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement.&lt;br&gt;Where under the applicable accounting framework an institution recognises the variation margin paid in cash to the counterparty as a receivable asset, it may exclude that asset from the exposure measure provided that the conditions in points (a) to (e) are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of paragraph 3 the following shall apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the deduction of variation margin received shall be limited to the positive current replacement cost portion of the exposure value;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an institution shall not use variation margin received in cash to reduce the potential future credit exposure amount, including for the purposes of Article 298(1)(c)(ii);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the treatment laid down in paragraph 1, for written credit derivatives institutions shall include in the exposure value the effective notional amounts referenced by the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to the written credit derivative. The resulting exposure value may be further reduced by the effective notional amount of a purchased credit derivative on the same reference name provided that all the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for single name credit derivatives, the credit derivatives purchased must be on a reference name which ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying reference obligation of the written credit derivative and a credit event on the senior reference asset would result in a credit event on the subordinated asset;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where an institution purchases protection on a pool of reference names, the purchased protection may offset sold protection on a pool of reference names only if the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are identical;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remaining maturity of the credit derivative purchased is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in determining the additional exposure value for written credit derivatives, the notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to the credit derivative purchased;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for tranched products, the credit derivative purchased as protection is on a reference obligation which ranks equal to the underlying reference obligation of the written credit derivative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;Where the notional amount of a written credit derivative is not reduced by the notional amount of a purchased credit derivative, institutions may deduct the individual potential future exposure of that written credit derivative from the total potential future exposure determined according to paragraph 1 of this Article in conjunction with Article 274(2) or Article 299(2)(a) as applicable. In case that the potential future credit exposure shall be determined in conjunction with Article 298(1)(c)(ii), PCE &lt;span class=&quot;crrSub&quot;&gt; gross &lt;/span&gt; may be reduced by the individual potential future exposure of written credit derivatives with no adjustment made to the NGR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutions shall not reduce the written credit derivative effective notional amount where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative reflected in Tier 1 capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference entities, institutions may recognise a reduction according to paragraph 5 on written credit derivatives on individual reference names only if the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual names in the pool. If an institution purchases a credit derivative on a pool of reference names, it may only recognise a reduction on a pool of written credit derivatives when the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are identical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Article 275 to determine the exposure value of contracts listed in points 1 and 2 of Annex II only where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purposes of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92.&lt;br&gt;When institutions apply the method set out in Article 275, they shall not reduce the exposure measure by the amount of variation margin received in cash.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;where the institution does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the transaction shall not be included in the exposure measure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where the institution is economically exposed to the underlying security or cash in the transaction beyond the exposure covered by the add-on, it shall include also in the exposure measure an exposure equal to the full amount of the security or cash.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the authority determined in accordance with paragraph 1 identifies changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State and which that authority considers would better be addressed by means of stricter national measures, it shall notify the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the ESRB and EBA of that fact and submit relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence of all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reasons why such changes could pose a threat to financial stability at national level;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a justification of why Articles 124 and 164 of this Regulation and Articles 101, 103, 104, 105, 133, and 136 of Directive 2013/36/EU cannot adequately address the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, taking into account the relative effectiveness of those measures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draft national measures for domestically authorised institutions, or a subset of those institutions, intended to mitigate the changes in the intensity of risk and concerning:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrRomanList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the level of own funds laid down in Article 92;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an explanation as to why the draft measures are deemed by the authority determined in accordance with paragraph 1 to be suitable, effective and proportionate to address the situation; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the draft measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State concerned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When authorised to apply national measures in accordance with this Article, the authorities determined in accordance with paragraph 1 shall provide relevant competent authorities or designated authorities in other Member States with all relevant information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power to adopt an implementing act to reject the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of paragraph 2 is conferred on the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission.&lt;br&gt;Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the ESRB and EBA shall provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned.&lt;br&gt;Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.&lt;br&gt;In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.&lt;br&gt;The Council shall decide on the proposal by the Commission within one month after receipt of the proposal and state its reasons for rejecting or not rejecting the draft national measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council shall only reject the draft national measures if it considers that one or more of the following conditions are not complied with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk are of such nature as to pose risk to financial stability at national level;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the draft national measures are more suitable to address the identified macroprudential or systemic risk and do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the issue concerns only one Member State; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the risks have not already been addressed by other measures in this Regulation or in Directive 2013/36/EU.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Other Member States may recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article and apply them to domestically authorised branches located in the Member State authorised to apply the measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where Member States recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, they shall notify the Council, the Commission, EBA, the ESRB and the Member State authorised to apply the measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When deciding whether to recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, the Member State shall take into consideration the criteria set in paragraph 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Member State authorised to apply the measures may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more Member States which do not recognise the measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the expiry of the authorisation issued in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State shall, in consultation with the ESRB and EBA, review the situation and may adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 4, a new decision for the extension of the period of application of national measures for one additional year each time. After the first extension, the Commission shall in consultation with the ESRB and EBA review the situation at least annually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (vi) and (vii) of paragraph 2(d) of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements in paragraph 2 of this Article are met.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBA shall monitor the amount of required stable funding covering the funding risk linked to the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio, in particular the future funding risk for those derivative contracts set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2), and report to the Commission on the opportunity to adopt a higher required stable funding factor or a more risk-sensitive measure by 28 June 2024. That report shall at least assess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to distinguish between margined and unmargined derivative contracts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to remove, increase or replace the requirement set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to change more broadly the treatment of derivative contracts in the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, as set out in Article 428d, Articles 428k(4) and 428s(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag, Articles 428ah(2), 428al(4) and 428at(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ay and Article 428az(2), to better capture the funding risk linked to those contracts over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for institutions&#x27; derivative contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If international standards affect the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 4, those changes of international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including to the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers and report to the Commission on the appropriateness of that treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to apply higher or lower stable funding factors to securities financing transactions with financial customers and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers to take better account of their funding risk over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio and of the possible contagion effects between financial customers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to apply the treatment set out in point (g) of Article 428r(1) to securities financing transactions collateralised by other types of assets;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to apply stable funding factors to off-balance-sheet items used in securities financing transactions as an alternative to the treatment set out in Article 428p(5);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with point (c) of Article 428k(3) and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and point (b) of Article 428v;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers, on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for those institutions&#x27; transactions, in particular for securities financing transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers where sovereign bonds are received as collateral in those transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 28 June 2024, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 6, any international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of securities financing transactions, including of the assets received or given in those transactions, and the treatment of unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions&#x27; net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 28 June 2025, the required stable funding factors applied to the transactions referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and in point (b) of Article 428v, shall be raised from 0 % to 10 %, from 5 % to 15 % and from 10 % to 15 % respectively, unless otherwise specified in a legislative act adopted on the basis of a proposal by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to institutions&#x27; holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts. EBA shall report on the appropriateness of the treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the possible impact of the treatment on investors&#x27; ability to gain exposure to assets and the impact of the treatment on credit supply in the capital markets union;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are funded by initial margin, either wholly or in part;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions&#x27; holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions&#x27; net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less. EBA shall submit its report to the Commission by 28 June 2021.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the current macroprudential tools in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and transparent;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap between different macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are adequate and, if appropriate, propose new macroprudential rules;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how internationally agreed standards for systemic institutions interact with the provisions in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU and, if appropriate, propose new rules taking into account those internationally agreed standards;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether other types of instruments, such as borrower-based instruments, should be added to the macroprudential tools provided for in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU to complement capital-based instruments and to allow for the harmonised use of the instruments in the internal market; taking into account whether harmonised definitions of those instruments and the reporting of respective data at Union level are a prerequisite for the introduction of such instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the leverage ratio buffer requirement as referred to in Article 92(1a) should be extended to systemically important institutions other than G-SIIs, whether its calibration should be different from the calibration for G-SIIs, and whether its calibration should depend on the level of systemic importance of the institution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the current voluntary reciprocity of macroprudnetial measures should be turned into mandatory reciprocity and whether the current ESRB framework for voluntary reciprocity is an appropriate basis for that;&lt;/li&gt;
