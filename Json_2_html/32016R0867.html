&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the relevant NCB of the legal entity may decide not to collect any, or to collect only part, of the data attributes listed in Template 1 of Annex I from the legal entity, when such instruments are held or serviced by the foreign branch;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Foreign branches that are not resident in a reporting Member State are not reporting agents under this Regulation. Reporting agents shall ensure that such foreign branches implement arrangements, processes and mechanisms to ensure the proper implementation of the reporting requirements on an individual basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The statistical reporting requirements under this Regulation are without prejudice to any other current or future reporting requirements with regard to credit data in accordance with national law or other reporting frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs may collect the information to be transmitted to the ECB as a part of a broader national reporting framework that complies with relevant Union or national law. These broader reporting frameworks may include information that serves other purposes besides statistical purposes, such as supervisory needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs may obtain credit data from other sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minimum requirements for harmonisation, completeness, level of detail and identification of counterparties, of credit data are set out in the templates in Annex I.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;if no LEI has been assigned, a national identifier, as further detailed in Annex IV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs may obtain any information related to the identification of counterparties as defined in Annex III through direct reporting by the reporting agents or through Memoranda of Understanding or similar arrangements with NSIs, NCAs and other national authorities.

&lt;li&gt;The ECB and NCBs shall use credit data reported under this Regulation to the extent and for the purposes defined in Regulation (EC) No 2533/98. Such data may be used, in particular, to establish and maintain a feedback loop in accordance with Article 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Regulation is without prejudice to existing or future uses of credit data that are permitted or required under Union or national law, or Memoranda of Understanding, including cross-border exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Access to and use of credit data</td><td>Article 10</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs have the right to provide credit data, including data collected by another NCB, to reporting agents by establishing or enhancing feedback loops or other information services from CCRs to reporting agents. They may provide a subset of the credit data collected under this Regulation, in line with best practices and to the extent allowed by the applicable legal confidentiality regime. Reporting agents may use the data exclusively for managing credit risk and improving the quality of credit information available to them with regard to existing or prospective instruments. They shall not share the data with other parties, unless data sharing with service providers is strictly necessary for these purposes, and the data are used only in relation to the reporting agent and the reporting agent ensures appropriate confidentiality protection under a contractual agreement that excludes any other use of the data, and provides for the anonymisation of the data wherever possible and deletion of the data as soon as the purpose for which they have been shared has been achieved. Any further data transmission by the service provider, and any data sharing with commercial providers of credit data is forbidden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs shall define the scope of data to be provided, the procedure for providing data access and any additional restrictions on the use of such data, taking into account the national legal framework and any other constraints linked to the confidential nature of the information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Article does not give reporting agents any right to a feedback loop, or to receiving specific information from a feedback loop or other information services from CCRs to reporting agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs have the right to deny access on a temporary basis for a reporting agent to specific credit data from a feedback loop where the reporting agent has not complied with its own statistical reporting obligations under this Regulation, in particular with regard to data quality and accuracy, and in cases where a reporting agent has not complied with its obligations set out in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCBs have the right to deny access to other NCBs to the granular credit data that they collect for the purposes of a feedback loop. NCBs have the right to require reciprocity as regards provision of granular credit data with any NCB that requests data from another NCB for the purposes of a feedback loop. Information on an institutional unit of a reporting agent established in a reporting Member State may always be used for feedback loops by the relevant NCB of the reporting agent, irrespective of where the institutional unit is resident.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Legal entities or parts of legal entities about which credit data have been reported are entitled to access such data at the relevant NCB. Furthermore, legal entities may request that reporting agents rectify incorrect data that relate to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCBs may deny a legal entity or parts of legal entities access to the credit data reported in relation to them, only to the extent that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such access would violate the legitimate confidentiality interests of the reporting agent, for example with regard to internal credit risk assessments, or of third parties, in particular, the legal entities about which credit data has been reported; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data has not been used to establish or enhance a feedback loop according to Article 11, and they are not required to grant access to such data under any other Union or national law.&lt;/li&gt;

When a change occurs, NCBs shall update the data by no later than the transmission of credit data that is relevant for the first reporting reference date on or before which the change came into effect. Unless NCBs inform reporting agents that they have obtained updated counterparty reference data from other sources, reporting agents shall update such data by informing NCBs of any changes at the time requested by the relevant NCB, but no later than the date on which credit data is reported to the relevant NCB for the first reporting reference date following the date on which the change came into effect.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to the obligations set out in the previous paragraph, the relevant NCB may authorise the acquiring institution to fulfil its statistical reporting obligation through temporary procedures. This exemption from normal reporting procedures shall last no longer than six months from the date on which the merger, division or reorganisation took place.

The derogations may cover some or all reporting requirements defined in this Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to support the implementation of the reporting requirements, the relevant NCB may allow small reporting agents to report credit data relating to reporting reference dates prior to 1 January 2021 on a quarterly instead of a monthly basis, provided that the combined contribution of all agents reporting on a quarterly basis to the total outstanding amount of loans reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1071/2013 by all reporting agents resident in the reporting Member State does not exceed 4 %, without prejudice to their reporting credit data under any other legal framework.&lt;/li&gt;
