&lt;li&gt;they are separated from general communication channels of the competent authority, including those through which the competent authority communicates internally and with third parties in its ordinary course of business;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a recorded telephone line is used for reporting of infringements, the competent authority shall have the right to document the oral reporting in the form of:&lt;/p&gt;
