&lt;li&gt;put in place such risk measurement arrangements, processes and techniques as are necessary to ensure that the risks of taken positions and their contribution to the overall risk profile are accurately measured on the basis of sound and reliable data and that the risk measurement arrangements, processes and techniques are adequately documented;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require management companies to ensure that for each UCITS they manage the liquidity profile of the investments of the UCITS is appropriate to the redemption policy laid down in the fund rules or the instruments of incorporation or the prospectus.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member States shall require management companies to calculate the global exposure of a managed UCITS as referred to in Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC as either of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the incremental exposure and leverage generated by the managed UCITS through the use of financial derivative instruments including embedded derivatives pursuant to the fourth subparagraph of Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC, which may not exceed the total of the UCITS net asset value;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market risk of the UCITS portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require management companies to calculate the UCITS global exposure on at least a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may allow management companies to calculate global exposure by using the commitment approach, the value at risk approach or other advanced risk measurement methodologies as may be appropriate. For the purposes of this provision, value at risk shall mean a measure of the maximum expected loss at a given confidence level over a specific time period.Member States shall require management companies to ensure that the method selected to measure global exposure is appropriate, taking into account the investment strategy pursued by the UCITS and the types and complexities of the financial derivative instruments used, and the proportion of the UCITS portfolio which comprises financial derivative instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a UCITS in accordance with Article 51(2) of Directive 2009/65/EC employs techniques and instruments including repurchase agreements or securities lending transactions in order to generate additional leverage or exposure to market risk, Member States shall require management companies to take these transactions into consideration when calculating global exposure.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where the commitment approach is used for the calculation of global exposure, Member States shall require management companies to apply this approach to all financial derivative instrument positions including embedded derivatives as referred to in the fourth subparagraph of Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC, whether used as part of the UCITS general investment policy, for purposes of risk reduction or for the purposes of efficient portfolio management as referred to in Article 51(2) of that Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the commitment approach is used for the calculation of global exposure, Member States shall require management companies to convert each financial derivative instrument position into the market value of an equivalent position in the underlying asset of that derivative (standard commitment approach).Member States may allow management companies to apply other calculation methods which are equivalent to the standard commitment approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may allow a management company to take account of netting and hedging arrangements when calculating global exposure, where these arrangements do not disregard obvious and material risks and result in a clear reduction in risk exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the use of financial derivative instruments does not generate incremental exposure for the UCITS, the underlying exposure need not be included in the commitment calculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the commitment approach is used, temporary borrowing arrangements entered into on behalf of the UCITS in accordance with Article 83 of Directive 2009/65/EC need not be included in the global exposure calculation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When calculating the UCITS exposure to a counterparty in accordance with the limits as referred to in Article 52(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, management companies shall use the positive mark-to-market value of the OTC derivative contract with that counterparty.Management companies may net the derivative positions of a UCITS with the same counterparty, provided that they are able to legally enforce netting agreements with the counterparty on behalf of the UCITS. Netting shall only be permissible with respect to OTC derivative instruments with the same counterparty and not in relation to any other exposures the UCITS may have with that same counterparty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may allow management companies to reduce the UCITS exposure to a counterparty of an OTC derivative transaction through the receipt of collateral. Collateral received shall be sufficiently liquid so that it can be sold quickly at a price that is close to its pre-sale valuation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require management companies to take collateral into account in calculating exposure to counterparty risk as referred to in Article 52(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC when the management company passes collateral to OTC counterparty on behalf of the UCITS. Collateral passed may be taken into account on a net basis only if the management company is able to legally enforce netting arrangements with this counterparty on behalf of the UCITS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall require management companies to calculate issuer concentration limits as referred to in Article 52 of Directive 2009/65/EC on the basis of the underlying exposure created through the use of financial derivative instruments pursuant to the commitment approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With respect to the exposure arising from OTC derivatives transactions as referred to in Article 52(2) of Directive 2009/65/EC, Member States shall require management companies to include in the calculation any exposure to OTC derivative counterparty risk.&lt;/li&gt;
