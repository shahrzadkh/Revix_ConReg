&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basis risk means the risk arising from less than perfectly correlated movements between two or more assets or contracts cleared by the central counterparty (CCP);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confidence interval means the percentage of exposures movements for each financial instrument cleared with reference to a specific lookback period that a CCP is required to cover over a certain liquidation period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convenience yield means the benefits from direct ownership of the physical commodity and is affected both by market conditions and by factors such as physical storage costs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;margins means margins as referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 which may include initial margins and variation margins;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial margin means margins collected by the CCP to cover potential future exposure to clearing members providing the margin and, where relevant, interoperable CCPs in the interval between the last margin collection and the liquidation of positions following a default of a clearing member or of an interoperable CCP default;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variation margin means margins collected or paid out to reflect current exposures resulting from actual changes in market price;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jump to default risk means the risk that a counterparty or issuer defaults suddenly before the market has had time to factor in its increased default risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liquidation period means the time period used for the calculation of the margins that the CCP estimates necessary to manage its exposure to a defaulting member and during which the CCP is exposed to market risk related to the management of the defaulter’s positions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lookback period means the time horizon for the calculation of historical volatility;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing exception means the result of a test which shows that a CCP’s model or liquidity risk management framework did not result in the intended level of coverage;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wrong-way risk means the risk arising from exposure to a counterparty or issuer when the collateral provided by that counterparty or issued by that issuer is highly correlated with its credit risk.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the design of the risk management, compliance and internal control functions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the processes for ensuring accountability to stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall have adequate staff to meet all obligations arising from this Regulation and from Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. A CCP shall not share its staff with other group entities, unless under the terms of an outsourcing arrangement in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall establish lines of responsibility which are clear, consistent and well-documented. A CCP shall ensure that the functions of the chief risk officer, chief compliance officer and chief technology officer are carried out by different individuals, who shall be employees of the CCP entrusted with the exclusive responsibility of performing these functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP that is part of a group shall take into account any implications of the group for its own governance arrangements including whether it has the necessary level of independence to meet its regulatory obligations as a distinct legal person and whether its independence could be compromised by the group structure or by any board member also being a member of the board of other entities of the same group. In particular, such a CCP shall consider specific procedures for preventing and managing conflicts of interest including with respect to outsourcing arrangements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a CCP maintains a two-tiered board system, the role and responsibilities of the board as established in this Regulation and in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 shall be allocated to the supervisory board and the management board as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk management policies, procedures, systems and controls shall be part of a coherent and consistent governance framework that is reviewed and updated regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Governance arrangements</td><td>Article 3</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall have a sound framework for the comprehensive management of all material risks to which it is or may be exposed. A CCP shall establish documented policies, procedures and systems that identify, measure, monitor and manage such risks. In establishing risk-management policies, procedures and systems, a CCP shall structure them in a way as to ensure that clearing members properly manage and contain the risks they pose to the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall take an integrated and comprehensive view of all relevant risks. These shall include the risks it bears from and poses to its clearing members and, to the extent practicable, clients as well as the risks it bears from and poses to other entities such as, but not limited to interoperable CCPs, securities settlement and payment systems, settlement banks, liquidity providers, central securities depositories, trading venues served by the CCP and other critical service providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall develop appropriate risk management tools to be in a position to manage and report on all relevant risks. These shall include the identification and management of system, market or other interdependencies. If a CCP provides services linked to clearing that present a distinct risk profile from its functions and potentially pose significant additional risks to it, the CCP shall manage those additional risks adequately. This may include separating legally the additional services that the CCP provides from its core functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The governance arrangements shall ensure that the board of a CCP assumes final responsibility and accountability for managing the CCP’s risks. The board shall define, determine and document an appropriate level of risk tolerance and risk bearing capacity for the CCP. The board and senior management shall ensure that the CCP’s policies, procedures and controls are consistent with the CCP’s risk tolerance and risk bearing capacity and that they address how the CCP identifies, reports, monitors and manages risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall employ robust information and risk-control systems to provide the CCP and, where appropriate, its clearing members and, where possible, clients with the capacity to obtain timely information and to apply risk management policies and procedures appropriately. These systems shall ensure, at least that credit and liquidity exposures are monitored continuously at the CCP level as well as at the clearing member level and, to the extent practicable, at the client level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall ensure that the risk management function has the necessary authority, resources, expertise and access to all relevant information and that it is sufficiently independent from the other functions of the CCP. The CCP chief risk officer shall implement the risk management framework including the policies and procedures established by the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall have adequate internal control mechanisms to assist the board in monitoring and assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of a its risk management policies, procedures and systems. Such mechanisms shall include sound administrative and accounting procedures, a robust compliance function and an independent internal audit and validation or review function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP’s financial statement shall be prepared on an annual basis and be audited by statutory auditors or audit firms within the meaning of Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the CouncilOJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87..&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall ensure that its rules, procedures and contractual arrangements are clear and comprehensive and they ensure compliance with this Regulation, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1249/2012 as well as all other applicable regulatory and supervisory requirements.&lt;br&gt;The rules, procedures and contractual arrangements of the CCP shall be recorded in writing or another durable medium. These rules, procedures, and contractual arrangements and any accompanying material shall be accurate, up-to-date and readily available to the competent authority, clearing members and, where appropriate, clients.&lt;br&gt;A CCP shall identify and analyse the soundness of the rules, procedures and contractual arrangements of the CCP. If necessary, independent legal opinions shall be sought for the purpose of this analysis. The CCP shall have a process for proposing and implementing changes to its rules and procedures and prior to implementing any material changes to consult with all affected clearing members and submit the proposed changes to the competent authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In developing its rules, procedures and contractual arrangements a CCP shall consider relevant regulatory principles and industry standards and market protocols and clearly indicate where such practices have been incorporated into the documentation governing the rights and obligations of the CCP, its clearing members and other relevant third parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall identify and analyse potential conflicts of law issues and develop rules and procedures to mitigate legal risk resulting from such issues. If necessary, independent legal opinions shall be sought by the CCP for the purpose of this analysis.&lt;br&gt;A CCP’s rules and procedures shall clearly indicate the law that is intended to apply to each aspect of the CCP’s activities and operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Compliance policy and procedures</td><td>Article 5</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall establish and maintain a permanent and effective compliance function which operates independently from the other functions of the CCP.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief compliance officer shall at least have the following responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor and, on a regular basis, assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the measures put in place in accordance with Article 5(4) and the actions taken to address any deficiencies in the CCP’s compliance with its obligations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;administer the compliance policies and procedures established by senior management and the board;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;advise and assist the persons responsible for carrying out the CCP services and activities to comply with the CCP’s obligations under this Regulation, Regulation (EC) No 648/2012 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1249/2012 and other regulatory requirements, where applicable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;report regularly to the board on compliance by the CCP and its employees with this Regulation, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1249/2012;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish procedures for the effective remediation of instances of non-compliance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that the relevant persons involved in the compliance function are not involved in the performance of the services or activities they monitor and that any conflicts of interest of such persons are properly identified and eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;

The risk committee established in accordance with Article 28 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 shall be an advisory committee to the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board shall assume at least the following responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the establishment of clear objectives and strategies for the CCP;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior management shall have at least the following responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring consistency of the CCP’s activities with the objectives and strategy of the CCP as determined by the board;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;designing and establishing compliance and internal control procedures that promote the CCP’s objectives;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;be actively involved in the risk control process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring that risks posed to the CCP by its clearing and activities linked to clearing are duly addressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the board delegates tasks to committees or sub-committees, it shall retain the approval of decisions that could have a significant impact on the risk profile of the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The arrangements by which the board and senior management operate shall include processes to identify, address and manage potential conflicts of interest of members of the board and senior management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall have clear and direct reporting lines between its board and senior management in order to ensure that the senior management is accountable for its performance. The reporting lines for risk management, compliance and internal audit shall be clear and separate from those for the other operations of the CCP. The chief risk officer shall report to the board either directly or through the chair of the risk committee. The chief compliance officer and the internal audit function shall report directly to the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Organisational structure and separation of the reporting lines</td><td>Article 7</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remuneration committee shall design and further develop the remuneration policy, oversee its implementation by senior management and review its practical operation on a regular basis. The policy itself shall be documented and reviewed at least on an annual basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remuneration policy shall be designed to align the level and structure of remuneration with prudent risk management. The policy shall account for prospective risks as well as existing risks and risk outcomes. Pay out schedules shall be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. In particular in the case of variable remuneration the policy shall take due account of possible mismatches of performance and risk periods and shall ensure that payments are deferred as appropriate. The fixed and variable components of total remuneration shall be balanced and shall be consistent with risk alignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remuneration policy shall provide that staff engaged in risk management, compliance and internal audit functions are remunerated in a manner that is independent of the business performance of the CCP. The level of remuneration shall be adequate in terms of responsibility as well as in comparison to the level of remuneration in the business areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remuneration policy shall be subject to independent audit, on an annual basis. The results of these audits shall be made available to the competent authority.&lt;/li&gt;

The systems shall be designed to deal with the CCP’s operational needs and the risks the CCP faces, be resilient, including in stressed market conditions, and be scalable, if necessary, to process additional information. The CCP shall provide for procedures and capacity planning as well as for sufficient redundant capacity to allow the system to process all remaining transactions before the end of the day in circumstances where a major disruption occurs. The CCP shall provide for procedures for the introduction of new technology including clear reversion plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to ensure a high degree of security in information processing and to enable connectivity with its clearing members and clients as well as with its service providers, a CCP shall base its information technology systems on internationally recognised technical standards and industry best practices. The CCP shall subject its systems to stringent testing, simulating stressed conditions, before initial use, after making significant changes and after a major disruption has occurred. Clearing members and clients, interoperable CCPs and other interested parties shall be involved as appropriate in the design and conduct of these tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall maintain a robust information security framework that appropriately manages its information security risk. The framework shall include appropriate mechanisms, policies and procedures to protect information from unauthorised disclosure, to ensure data accuracy and integrity and to guarantee the availability of the CCP’s services.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A CCP may use any other time horizon for the calculation of historical volatility provided that the use of such time horizon results in margin requirements at least as high as those obtained with the time period defined in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin parameters for financial instruments without a historical observation period shall be based on conservative assumptions. A CCP shall promptly adapt the calculation of the required margins based on the analysis of the price history of the new financial instruments.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the longest possible period that may elapse from the last collection of margins up to the declaration of default by the CCP or activation of the default management process by the CCP;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the estimated period needed to design and execute the strategy for the management of the default of a clearing member according to the particularities of each class of financial instrument, including its level of liquidity and the size and concentration of the positions, and the markets the CCP will use to close-out or hedge completely a clearing member position;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The CCP shall document its approach on portfolio margining and it shall at least provide that the correlation, or an equivalent statistical parameter of dependence, between two or more financial instruments cleared is shown to be reliable over the lookback period calculated in accordance with Article 25 and demonstrates resilience during stressed historical or hypothetical scenarios. The CCP shall demonstrate the existence of an economic rationale for the price relation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All financial instruments to which portfolio margining is applied shall be covered by the same default fund. By way of derogation, if a CCP can demonstrate in advance to its competent authority and to its clearing members how potential losses would be allocated among different default funds and has set out the necessary provisions in its rules, portfolio margining may be applied to financial instruments covered by different default funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where portfolio margining covers multiple instruments, the amount of margin reductions shall be no greater than 80 % of the difference between the sum of the margins for each product calculated on an individual basis and the margin calculated based on a combined estimation of the exposure for the combined portfolio. Where the CCP is not exposed to any potential risk from the margin reduction, it may apply a reduction of up to 100 % of that difference.&lt;/li&gt;

This shall include avoiding when possible disruptive or big step changes in margin requirements and establishing transparent and predictable procedures for adjusting margin requirements in response to changing market conditions. In doing so, the CCP shall employ at least one of the following options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall conduct sensitivity tests and analysis to assess the coverage of its margin model under various market conditions using historical data from realised stressed market conditions and hypothetical data for unrealised stressed market conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP shall use a wide range of parameters and assumptions to capture a variety of historical and hypothetical conditions, including the most-volatile periods that have been experienced by the markets it serves and extreme changes in the correlations between prices of contracts cleared by the CCP, in order to understand how the level of margin coverage might be affected by highly stressed market conditions and changes in important model parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitivity analysis shall be performed on a number of actual and representative clearing member portfolios. The representative portfolios shall be chosen based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and correlations to which the CCP is exposed. Such sensitivity testing and analysis shall be designed to test the key parameters and assumptions of the initial margin model at a number of confidence intervals to determine the sensitivity of the system to errors in the calibration of such parameters and assumptions. Appropriate consideration shall be given to the term structure of the risk factors, and the assumed correlation between risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A CCP’s stress testing programme shall require the CCP to conduct a range of stress tests on a regular basis that shall consider the CCP’s product mix and all elements of its models and their methodologies and its liquidity risk management framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CCP’s stress testing programme shall prescribe that stress tests are performed, using defined stress testing scenarios, on both past and hypothetical extreme but plausible market conditions in accordance with Chapter VII. Past conditions to be used shall be reviewed and adjusted, where appropriate. A CCP shall also consider other forms of appropriate stress testing scenarios including, but not limited to, the technical or financial failure of its settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, liquidity providers, or interoperable CCPs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CCP shall identify, and have an appropriate method for measuring, relevant risk factors specific to the contracts it clears that could affect its losses. A CCP’s stress tests shall, at least, take into account risk factors specified for the following type of financial instruments, where applicable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest rate related contracts: risk factors corresponding to interest rates in each currency in which the CCP clears financial instruments. The yield curve modelling shall be divided into various maturity segments in order to capture variation in the volatility of rates along the yield curve. The number of related risk factors shall depend on the complexity of the interest rate contracts cleared by the CCP. Basis risk, arising from less than perfectly correlated movements between government and other fixed-income interest rates, shall be captured separately;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exchange rate related contracts: risk factors corresponding to each foreign currency in which the CCP clears financial instruments and to the exchange rate between the currency in which margin calls are made and the currency in which the CCP clears financial instruments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity related contracts: risk factors corresponding to the volatility of individual equity issues for each of the markets cleared by the CCP and to the volatility of various sectors of the overall equity market. The sophistication and nature of the modelling technique for a given market shall correspond to the CCP’s exposure to the overall market as well as its concentration in individual equity issues in that market;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodity contracts: risk factors that take into account the different categories and sub-categories of commodity contracts and related derivatives cleared by the CCP, including, where appropriate, variations in the convenience yield between derivatives positions and cash positions in the commodity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit related contracts: risk factors that consider jump to default risk, including the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, basis risk and recovery rate volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its stress tests, a CCP shall also give appropriate consideration at least to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correlations, including those between identified risk factors and similar contracts cleared by the CCP;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;factors corresponding to the implied and historical volatility of the contract being cleared;&lt;/li&gt;
