The provisions of this Directive shall be applicable to the extent that a matter is not mandatorily regulated in those sector-specific Union acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Directive shall not affect the responsibility of Member States to ensure national security or their power to protect their essential security interests. In particular, it shall not apply to reports of breaches of the procurement rules involving defence or security aspects unless they are covered by the relevant acts of the Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Directive shall not affect the application of Union or national law relating to any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;they had reasonable grounds to believe that the information on breaches reported was true at the time of reporting and that such information fell within the scope of this Directive; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they reported either internally in accordance with Article 7 or externally in accordance with Article 10, or made a public disclosure in accordance with Article 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without prejudice to existing obligations to provide for anonymous reporting by virtue of Union law, this Directive does not affect the power of Member States to decide whether legal entities in the private or public sector and competent authorities are required to accept and follow up on anonymous reports of breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persons who reported or publicly disclosed information on breaches anonymously, but who are subsequently identified and suffer retaliation, shall nonetheless qualify for the protection provided for under Chapter VI, provided that they meet the conditions laid down in paragraph 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persons reporting to relevant institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union breaches falling within the scope of this Directive shall qualify for protection as laid down in this Directive under the same conditions as persons who report externally.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;As a general principle and without prejudice to Articles 10 and 15, information on breaches may be reported through the internal reporting channels and procedures provided for in this Chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall encourage reporting through internal reporting channels before reporting through external reporting channels, where the breach can be addressed effectively internally and where the reporting person considers that there is no risk of retaliation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appropriate information relating to the use of internal reporting channels referred to in paragraph 2 shall be provided in the context of the information given by legal entities in the private and public sector pursuant to point (g) of Article 9(1), and by competent authorities pursuant to point (a) of Article 12(4) and Article 13.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</td><td>Reporting through internal reporting channels</td><td>Article 7</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;ol class=&quot;crrNumList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that legal entities in the private and public sector establish channels and procedures for internal reporting and for follow-up, following consultation and in agreement with the social partners where provided for by national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The channels and procedures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall enable the entity&#x27;s workers to report information on breaches. They may enable other persons, referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 4(1) and Article 4(2), who are in contact with the entity in the context of their work-related activities to also report information on breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 1 shall apply to legal entities in the private sector with 50 or more workers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threshold laid down in paragraph 3 shall not apply to the entities falling within the scope of Union acts referred to in Parts I.B and II of the Annex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting channels may be operated internally by a person or department designated for that purpose or provided externally by a third party. The safeguards and requirements referred to in Article 9(1) shall also apply to entrusted third parties operating the reporting channel for a legal entity in the private sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal entities in the private sector with 50 to 249 workers may share resources as regards the receipt of reports and any investigation to be carried out. This shall be without prejudice to the obligations imposed upon such entities by this Directive to maintain confidentiality, to give feedback, and to address the reported breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following an appropriate risk assessment taking into account the nature of the activities of the entities and the ensuing level of risk for, in particular, the environment and public health, Member States may require legal entities in the private sector with fewer than 50 workers to establish internal reporting channels and procedures in accordance with Chapter II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall notify the Commission of any decision they take to require legal entities in the private sector to establish internal reporting channels pursuant to paragraph 7. That notification shall include the reasons for the decision and the criteria used in the risk assessment referred to in paragraph 7. The Commission shall communicate that decision to the other Member States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paragraph 1 shall apply to all legal entities in the public sector, including any entity owned or controlled by such entities.&lt;br&gt;Member States may exempt from the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 municipalities with fewer than 10000 inhabitants or fewer than 50 workers, or other entities referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph with fewer than 50 workers.&lt;br&gt;Member States may provide that internal reporting channels can be shared between municipalities or operated by joint municipal authorities in accordance with national law, provided that the shared internal reporting channels are distinct from and autonomous in relation to the relevant external reporting channels.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedures for internal reporting and for follow-up as referred to in Article 8 shall include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;channels for receiving the reports which are designed, established and operated in a secure manner that ensures that the confidentiality of the identity of the reporting person and any third party mentioned in the report is protected, and prevents access thereto by non-authorised staff members;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acknowledgment of receipt of the report to the reporting person within seven days of that receipt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the designation of an impartial person or department competent for following-up on the reports which may be the same person or department as the one that receives the reports and which will maintain communication with the reporting person and, where necessary, ask for further information from and provide feedback to that reporting person;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diligent follow-up by the designated person or department referred to in point (c);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diligent follow-up, where provided for in national law, as regards anonymous reporting;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reasonable timeframe to provide feedback, not exceeding three months from the acknowledgment of receipt or, if no acknowledgement was sent to the reporting person, three months from the expiry of the seven-day period after the report was made;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provision of clear and easily accessible information regarding the procedures for reporting externally to competent authorities pursuant to Article 10 and, where relevant, to institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The channels provided for in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall enable reporting in writing or orally, or both.

&lt;p&gt;Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;crrCharList&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish independent and autonomous external reporting channels, for receiving and handling information on breaches;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promptly, and in any event within seven days of receipt of the report, acknowledge that receipt unless the reporting person explicitly requested otherwise or the competent authority reasonably believes that acknowledging receipt of the report would jeopardise the protection of the reporting person&#x27;s identity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diligently follow up on the reports;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide feedback to the reporting person within a reasonable timeframe not exceeding three months, or six months in duly justified cases;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;transmit in due time the information contained in the report to competent institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union, as appropriate, for further investigation, where provided for under Union or national law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may provide that competent authorities, after having duly assessed the matter, can decide that a reported breach is clearly minor and does not require further follow-up pursuant to this Directive, other than closure of the procedure. This shall not affect other obligations or other applicable procedures to address the reported breach, or the protection granted by this Directive in relation to internal or external reporting. In such a case, the competent authorities shall notify the reporting person of their decision and the reasons therefor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may provide that competent authorities can decide to close procedures regarding repetitive reports which do not contain any meaningful new information on breaches compared to a past report in respect of which the relevant procedures were concluded, unless new legal or factual circumstances justify a different follow-up. In such a case, the competent authorities shall notify the reporting person of their decision and the reasons therefor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States may provide that, in the event of high inflows of reports, competent authorities may deal with reports of serious breaches or breaches of essential provisions falling within the scope of this Directive as a matter of priority, without prejudice to the timeframe as set out in point (d) of paragraph 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Member States shall ensure that any authority which has received a report but does not have the competence to address the breach reported transmits it to the competent authority, within a reasonable time, in a secure manner, and that the reporting person is informed, without delay, of such a transmission.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;they are designed, established and operated in a manner that ensures the completeness, integrity and confidentiality of the information and prevents access thereto by non-authorised staff members of the competent authority;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they enable the durable storage of information in accordance with Article 18 to allow further investigations to be carried out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The external reporting channels shall enable reporting in writing and orally. Oral reporting shall be possible by telephone or through other voice messaging systems and, upon request by the reporting person, by means of a physical meeting within a reasonable timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competent authorities shall ensure that, where a report is received through channels other than the reporting channels referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 or by staff members other than those responsible for handling reports, the staff members who receive it are prohibited from disclosing any information that might identify the reporting person or the person concerned, and that they promptly forward the report without modification to the staff members responsible for handling reports.&lt;/li&gt;
