If the Commission concludes in the report that the introduction of an 80 % EU public debt quota and the phasing out of public debt CNAV MMFs that include an unlimited amount of non-EU public debt are not feasible, it should present the reasons for that. In the event that the Commission concludes that the introduction of an 80 % EU public debt quota is feasible, the Commission may make legislative proposals to introduce such a quota, whereby at least 80 % of the assets of public debt CNAV MMFs are to be invested in EU public debt instruments. In addition, if the Commission concludes that LVNAV MMFs have become an appropriate alternative to non-EU public debt CNAV MMFs, it may make appropriate proposals to remove the derogation for public debt CNAV MMFs altogether.<br>The results of the review shall be communicated to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, where necessary, by appropriate proposals for amendments.</li>\n</ol>","SUBTITLE":"Review","TITLE":"Article 46"},{"CONTENT":"<div class=\"crrArticle\">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.<br>It shall apply from 21 July 2018, with the exception of Article 11(4), Article 15(7), Article 22 and Article 37(4) which shall apply from 20 July 2017.</div>","SUBTITLE":"Entry into force","TITLE":"Article 47"}],"SUBTITLE":"Final provisions","TITLE":"CHAPTER IX"}]}}
