In order to allow for more efficient data processing by ESMA and simplification of data reporting for registered and certified credit rating agencies, integrated reporting requirements should be laid down for all the data that registered and certified credit rating agencies should report to ESMA. Therefore, this Regulation lays down rules regarding the data to be reported for the purpose of the ERP, the information to be made available on historical performance in the central repository established by ESMA, and the information that credit rating agencies should periodically report to ESMA for the purposes of ongoing supervision of credit rating agencies. This Regulation therefore repeals Delegated Regulation (EU) No 448/2012 and Delegated Regulation (EU) No 446/2012.

Press releases, in particular, provide information on the key elements underlying the rating decision.

Rating data should therefore be reported to ESMA on a monthly basis. However, in order to ensure proportionality, credit rating agencies that have fewer than 50 employees and that are not part of a group should be able to submit rating data every two months. ESMA should still be able to require those credit ratings agencies to carry out reporting on a monthly basis, in the light of the number and type of their ratings, including the complexity of the credit analysis, the relevance of the rated instruments or issuers, and the eligibility of the ratings to be used for regulatory purposes.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(7)</NO.P><TXT>In order to avoid duplicated data reporting, ESMA should use for its ongoing supervision the data already reported for the purposes of the ERP.
