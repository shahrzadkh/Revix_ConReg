European long-term investment funds (ELTIFs) provide finance of lasting duration to various infrastructure projects, unlisted companies, or listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that issue equity or debt instruments for which there is no readily identifiable buyer. By providing finance to such projects, ELTIFs contribute to the financing of the Union's real economy and the implementation of its policies.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(2)</NO.P><TXT>On the demand side, ELTIFs can provide a steady income stream for pension administrators, insurance companies, foundations, municipalities and other entities that face regular and recurrent liabilities and are seeking long-term returns within well-regulated structures.

ELTIFs can also offer good opportunities for capital appreciation over time for those investors not receiving a steady income stream.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>Financing for projects such as transport infrastructure, sustainable energy generation or distribution, social infrastructure (housing or hospitals), the roll-out of new technologies and systems that reduce use of resources and energy, or the further growth of SMEs, can be scarce. As the financial crisis has shown, complementing bank financing with a wider variety of financing sources that better mobilise capital markets could help tackle financing gaps. ELTIFs can play a crucial role in this respect, and can also mobilise capital by attracting third-country investors.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(4)</NO.P><TXT>The focus of this Regulation is to boost European long-term investments in the real economy. Long- term investments in projects, undertakings, and infrastructure in third countries can also bring capital to ELTIFs and thereby benefit the European economy. Therefore, such investments should not be prevented.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(5)</NO.P><TXT>In the absence of a regulation setting out rules on ELTIFs, diverging measures might be adopted at national level, which are likely to cause distortions of competition resulting from differences in investment protection measures. Diverging national requirements on portfolio composition, diversification, and eligible assets, in particular<?PAGE NO="99"?> investment in commodities, create obstacles to the cross-border marketing of investment funds that focus on unlisted undertakings and real assets because investors cannot easily compare the different investment propositions offered to them. Diverging national requirements also lead to different levels of investor protection. Furthermore, diverging national requirements pertaining to investment techniques, such as the permitted levels of borrowing, use of financial derivative instruments, rules applicable to short selling or to securities financing transactions, lead to discrepancies in the level of investor protection. In addition, diverging national requirements on redemption or holding periods impede the cross-border selling of funds investing in unlisted assets. By increasing legal uncertainty, those divergences can undermine the confidence of investors when considering investments in such funds and reduce the scope for investors to choose effectively between various long-term investment opportunities. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as interpreted by consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>Uniform rules are necessary to ensure that ELTIFs display a coherent and stable product profile across the Union. More specifically, in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and a high level of investor protection, it is necessary to establish uniform rules regarding the operation of ELTIFs, in particular on the composition of their portfolio and the investment instruments that they are allowed to use in order to gain exposure to long-term assets, such as equity or debt instruments issued by listed SMEs and by unlisted undertakings, as well as real assets. Uniform rules on the portfolio of an ELTIF are also required to ensure that ELTIFs that aim to generate regular income maintain a diversified portfolio of investment assets suitable for maintaining a regular cash flow. ELTIFs are a first step towards creating an integrated internal market for raising capital that can be channelled towards long-term investments in the European economy. The smooth functioning of the internal market for long-term investments requires the Commission to continue its assessment of potential barriers that might stand in the way of raising long-term capital across borders, including barriers that arise from the fiscal treatment of such investments.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(7)</NO.P><TXT>It is essential to ensure that the rules on the operation of ELTIFs, in particular regarding the composition of their portfolio and the investment instruments that they are allowed to use, be directly applicable to the managers of ELTIFs and, therefore, these new rules need to be adopted as a Regulation. This also ensures uniform conditions for the use of the designation <QUOT.START CODE="2018" ID="QS0001" REF.END="QE0001" />ELTIF<QUOT.END CODE="2019" ID="QE0001" REF.START="QS0001" />, by preventing the emergence of diverging national requirements.

At the same time, by adopting uniform rules, the complexity of the regulatory requirements applicable to ELTIFs is reduced. By means of uniform rules, the managers' cost of compliance with diverging national requirements governing funds that invest in listed and unlisted undertakings and comparable categories of real assets is also reduced. This is especially true for managers of ELTIFs that wish to raise capital on a cross-border basis. The adoption of uniform rules also contributes to the elimination of competitive distortions.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(8)</NO.P><TXT>The new rules on ELTIFs are closely linked to Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<NOTE NOTE.ID="E0004" NUMBERING="ARAB" TYPE="FOOTNOTE"><P>Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of <DATE ISO="20110608">8 June 2011</DATE> on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010 (<REF.DOC.OJ COLL="L" DATE.PUB="20110701" NO.OJ="174" PAGE.FIRST="1">OJ L 174, 1.7.2011, p. 1</REF.DOC.OJ>).</P></NOTE>, since that Directive forms the legal framework governing the management and marketing of alternative investment funds (AIFs) in the Union.

In particular, the management and marketing rules laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU should apply to ELTIFs. Equally, the rules on the cross-border provision of services and freedom of establishment laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU should apply correspondingly to the cross-border activities of ELTIFs.

Procedures should be put in place to ensure that only EU AIFMs authorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU and capable of managing an ELTIF may manage ELTIFs. All appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that an ELTIF will be able to comply with the harmonised rules governing the activity of these funds.

An ELTIF should invest at least 70 % of its capital in eligible investment assets. In order to ensure the integrity of ELTIFs, it is also desirable to prohibit an ELTIF from engaging in certain financial transactions that might endanger its investment strategy and objectives by giving rise to risks that are different from those that might be expected for a fund targeting long-term investments. In order to ensure a clear focus on long-term investments, as may be useful for retail investors unfamiliar with less conventional investment strategies, an ELTIF should not be allowed to invest in financial derivative instruments other than for the purpose of hedging the risks inherent to its own investments. Given the liquid nature of commodities and the financial derivative instruments that give an indirect exposure to them, investments in commodities do not require a long-term investor commitment and therefore should be excluded from eligible investment assets. That rationale does not apply to investments in infrastructure or companies related to commodities or whose performance is linked indirectly to the performance of commodities, such as farms in the case of agricultural commodities or power plants in the case of energy commodities.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(15)</NO.P><TXT>The definition of what constitutes a long-term investment is broad. Eligible investment assets are generally illiquid, require commitments for a certain period of time, and have an economic profile of a long-term nature. Eligible investment assets are non-transferable securities and therefore do not have access to the liquidity of secondary markets. They often require fixed term commitments which restrict their marketability. Nevertheless, as listed SMEs may face problems of liquidity and access to the secondary market, they should also be considered to be qualifying portfolio undertakings. The economic cycle of the investment sought by ELTIFs is essentially of a long-term nature due to the high capital commitments and the length of time required to produce returns.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(16)</NO.P><TXT>An ELTIF should be allowed to invest in assets other than eligible investment assets as may be necessary to manage its cash flow efficiently, but only so long as this is consistent with the ELTIF's long-term investment strategy.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(17)</NO.P><TXT>Eligible investment assets should be understood to include participations, such as equity or quasi-equity instruments, debt instruments in qualifying portfolio undertakings, and loans provided to them.

Direct holdings of real assets, unless they are securitised, should also form a category of eligible assets, provided that they yield a predictable cash flow, whether regular or irregular, in the sense that they can be modelled and valued based on a discounted cash flow valuation method. Those assets could indicatively include social infrastructure that yields a predictable return, such as energy, transport and communication infrastructure, as well as education, health,<?PAGE NO="101"?> welfare support or industrial facilities.
