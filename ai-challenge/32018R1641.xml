This Regulation specifies further the information to be provided by administrators in respect of their significant and critical benchmarks. It does not apply to administrators which only provide non-significant benchmarks. Where administrators provide non-significant as well as significant or critical benchmarks they should comply with this Regulation for their significant and critical benchmarks. ESMA may issue guidelines on the same subject for administrators of non-significant benchmarks.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(2)</NO.P><TXT>Benchmark methodologies differ hugely.

discretion may be exercised.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(4)</NO.P><TXT>To help potential users to choose the most appropriate benchmark from amongst a range of potentially suitable
