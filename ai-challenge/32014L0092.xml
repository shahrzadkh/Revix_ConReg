Entering new markets often entails large investment. Such investment is only justified if the provider foresees sufficient opportunities and a corresponding demand from consumers. The low level of mobility of consumers with respect to retail financial services is to a large extent due to the lack of transparency and comparability as regards the fees and services on offer, as well as difficulties in relation to the switching of payment accounts. Those factors also stifle demand.

Existing provisions at national level with respect to payment accounts, and particularly with respect to the comparability of fees and payment account switching, diverge. For switching, the lack of uniform binding measures at Union level has led to divergent practices and measures at national level. Those differences are even more marked in the area of comparability of fees, where no measures, even of a self-regulatory nature, exist at Union level. Should those differences become more significant in the future, as payment service providers tend to tailor their practices to national markets, this would raise the cost of operating across borders relative to the costs faced by domestic providers and would therefore make the pursuit of business on a cross-border basis less attractive. Cross-border activity in the internal market is hampered by obstacles to consumers opening a payment account abroad. Existing restrictive eligibility criteria may prevent Union citizens from moving freely within the Union.

However, the Commission’s 2009 study on tying practices in the financial sector, as well as relevant consultations and consumer complaints, have shown that payment service providers may offer payment accounts packaged with products not requested by consumers which are not essential for payment accounts, such as household insurance. Moreover, it has been observed that those practices may reduce transparency and comparability of prices, limit purchasing options for consumers and negatively impact upon their mobility. Therefore, Member States should ensure that when payment service providers offer packaged payment accounts consumers are provided with information on whether it is possible to purchase the payment account separately and if so, provide separate information regarding the applicable costs and fees associated with each of the other products or services included in the package that can be purchased separately.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(25)</NO.P><TXT>The process for switching payment accounts should be harmonised across the Union.

Such services should allow the purchase of goods and services online and should give consumers the opportunity to initiate payment orders via the credit institution’s online facility, where available.

For example, in some Member States consumers still widely use cheques, while that means of payment is very rarely used in other Member States. This Directive should therefore allow Member States to identify additional services that are considered essential at national level and which should be provided with a payment account with basic features in the Member State concerned.

In any event, such an approach should be without prejudice to the right of all consumers, including non-vulnerable ones, to access payment accounts with basic features at least at a reasonable fee.
