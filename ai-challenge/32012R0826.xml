Since the turnover calculation to determine exempted shares is also closely linked to the giving of information concerning shares where their principal trading venue is in the Union, it should also be covered by this Regulation. To ensure coherence between such provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations it is desirable to include all the regulatory technical standards required by Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 in a single Regulation.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(2)</NO.P><TXT>In relation to the notifications of net short positions on shares, sovereign debt and uncovered sovereign credit default swaps and to the public disclosure of significant net short positions on shares, uniform rules regarding the details of the information including the common standard to be used in the notification should be specified to ensure consistency in the application of the notification requirements across the Union, to foster efficiency in the reporting process and to provide comparable information to the public.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>To ensure the proper identification of the position holders, notification should, where available, include a code that can complement the name of the position holder.
