Therefore, assets eligible for the investments of the Fund and criteria for the composition of the portfolio should be defined with reference to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61. The eligibility of an asset for investment should not lead the Board to an automatic investment decision. Rather, the Board should always conduct an assessment of eligible assets. The interaction with the entire investment portfolio should be considered when determining the prudence of an individual investment. For instance, a volatile asset with a negative correlation to the portfolio could be judged in isolation as too risky but have a positive diversification effect for the overall portfolio.

In order to ensure sufficient geographical diversification, the Board should make use of readily available criteria, namely the principles referred to in Article 77 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, which imply the calculation of the shares of contributions of institutions established in each participating Member State. Given that those shares are based on the size of the contributing credit institutions and investment firms, and adjusted to their risk profile, they will be positively correlated with the size and depth of the corresponding financial markets. Since other considerations may warrant additional investments in a given participating Member State, a buffer should be introduced to allow further margin of appreciation by the Board, while ensuring minimum diversification across a sufficient number of participating Member States. In addition, since those shares may not be calculated for investments in non-participating Member States or third countries, they should be subject to limits to be set by the Board proportionally to those for participating Member States, on the basis of the similarities between countries.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>Criteria should be provided to further specify proportional diversification. It is prudent for the Board to limit the exposure to any particular issue or issuer and to make use of different maturities in order to meet its investment objectives. As regards individual issues, commercial paper is issued with an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) corresponding to the specific investment of the investor (in terms of maturity, amount and other characteristics), so that the investor owns 100 % of the security even if it does not own 100 % of the entire commercial paper programme. This should be taken into account when defining limits to the exposure to a particular issue. In addition, since irrevocable payment commitments may represent a significant share of the total amount of contributions to the Fund, the Board should also consider the collateral pledged to back irrevocable payment commitments when monitoring its overall concentration risk.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(7)</NO.P><TXT>Given the need to set up a prudent and safe investment strategy, the Board should limit its use of derivatives.

Transacting with certain central banks could also be consistent with the objective of minimising counterparty risk, provided that other risks, such as credit risk, are appropriately controlled.
