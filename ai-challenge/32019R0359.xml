In order to be registered or be granted an extension of registration under Regulation (EU) 2015/2365, trade repositories should demonstrate that they have established systems and procedures which ensure their ability to verify the completeness and correctness of the details of the securities financing transactions (SFTs).</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(10)</NO.P><TXT>The use of common resources within a trade repository between SFT reporting services on the one hand and ancillary services or derivative reporting services on the other may lead to contagion of operational risks across services. Whereas the validation, reconciliation, processing and recordkeeping of data may require an effective operational separation to avoid such contagion of risks, practices such as a common front-end of systems, a common access point to data for authorities or the use of the same staff working in sales, compliance, or a client services helpdesk may be less prone to contagion and hence do not necessarily require operational separation. Trade repositories should therefore establish an appropriate level of operational separation between the resources, systems or procedures used in different business lines, including where those business lines comprise the provision of services subject to other Union or third country legislation, and ensure that detailed and clear information on the ancillary services, or other business lines that the trade repository offers outside its core activity of repository services under Regulation (EU) 2015/2365, is provided to ESMA in the application for registration or extension of registration.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(11)</NO.P><TXT>The soundness, resilience and protection of the information technology systems of trade repositories are essential to ensure compliance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2015/2365.

To ensure the confidentiality of data, but also its availability to third parties, a trade repository should provide information about how it ensures that only the data for which the relevant counterparties have provided their explicit, revocable and discretionary consent is made available to third parties. Finally, the trade repository should provide information in its application on the channels and mechanisms used to publicly disclose information on its access rules in order to ensure an informed decision by its service users.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(13)</NO.P><TXT>The fees associated with the services provided by trade repositories are essential information for enabling market participants to make an informed choice and should therefore form part of the application for registration as a trade repository.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(14)</NO.P><TXT>Given that market participants and authorities rely on the data maintained by trade repositories, strict and effective operational and record-keeping arrangements should be clearly described in a trade repository's application for registration.
