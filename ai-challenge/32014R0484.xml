In order to minimise inconsistencies between the reference dates set for institutions and the dates set for central counterparties (CCPs) for the calculation and reporting of the information related to the hypothetical capital, the reference dates set for CCPs should cover at least the reference dates already set for institutions. However, a higher frequency of reporting of the information related to the hypothetical capital would also accommodate the fact that clearing members established in third countries can have different reporting dates. Furthermore, there might be large variations in own funds requirements and for them to have an updated view of those requirements, clearing members and their competent authorities might want to monitor those exposures more frequently than quarterly.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(2)</NO.P><TXT>In normal situations, the reporting dates for CCPs should not be delayed by more than one week with respect to the date of calculation. A week provides CCPs with sufficient time in order to perform all the internal controls and complete the necessary approval process before reporting the required data. If a CCP develops a fully automated system the reporting date can be close to the calculation date. Currently, however, CCPs might not have the capability to complete the entire process within this time and might therefore need to develop their internal processes and infrastructures in order to be able to do so. Against this background, a transitional provision should be introduced to give CCPs sufficient time to develop the necessary internal processes and infrastructures and, at the same time, to start reporting the information related to the hypothetical capital to their clearing members.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 the losses following the default of a clearing member would, in the first instance, be covered by the initial margin and by the default fund contribution of the defaulting member itself. Where those prove to be insufficient, the losses are covered by the pre-funded financial resources that are contributed by CCPs to their respective default waterfalls and by the pre-funded default fund contributions of the non-defaulting members. During this period, the frequency of reporting should be increased in order to keep the other non-defaulting clearing members and the competent authorities updated on all the information related to the hypothetical capital needed to calculate the clearing members' own fund requirements. CCPs should have the technical capabilities and the internal processes in place in order to compute and deliver the information related to the hypothetical capital under those stress situations.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(4)</NO.P><TXT>Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, a CCP has to replenish its pre-funded own financial resources in the default waterfall within one month. For this reason, the frequencies of calculation and reporting in these situations should be higher than the norm. Daily reporting of the information related to hypothetical capital could be less meaningful because it might take time to establish the total size of the losses following the clearing<?PAGE NO="58"?> member's default. Given that they may face a broad range of different scenarios, competent authorities should also have the option to request a higher frequency in periods of stress based on an assessment of the situation that should take into account the degree of actual or foreseen depletion of the pre-funded financial resources available to the CCP (both those contributed by the CCP itself and those contributed by clearing members). The higher frequency should apply until those resources are restored to levels required by the relevant legislation.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(5)</NO.P><TXT>The high frequency of reporting in periods of stress can be very demanding given the newly introduced reporting requirement.
