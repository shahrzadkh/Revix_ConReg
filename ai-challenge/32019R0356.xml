While margin lending therefore includes transactions subject to margin agreements between financial institutions and their clients where financial institutions provide prime brokerage services to their clients, it does not include other loans such as loans for corporate restructuring purposes which, despite the possibility of involving securities, do not contribute to the systemic risks addressed by Regulation (EU) 2015/2365.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>It is important that the details of any SFT cleared by a central counterparty are correctly reported and can be easily identified, irrespective of whether that SFT was cleared on the same date or on a later date than the date on which that SFT was concluded.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(4)</NO.P><TXT>To ensure comprehensive reporting where specific details of the collateral are not known on the day of the trade, counterparties should update information on the collateral as soon as that information becomes available to the counterparties, and no later than the working day following the value date of that SFT.</TXT></NP></CONSID><?PAGE NO="2"?><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(5)</NO.P><TXT>To provide more useful information to the authorities that access the details of SFTs in trade repositories, counterparties should report to the trade repositories the International Securities Identification Number (<QUOT.START CODE="2018" ID="QS0002" REF.END="QE0002"/>ISIN<QUOT.END CODE="2019" ID="QE0002" REF.START="QS0002"/>) of any collateral basket they use to provide collateral to an SFT, if that basket has an ISIN.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>Where counterparties provide collateral on a net exposure basis, resulting from the offsetting of a number of SFTs between two counterparties, a specific allocation of collateral to an individual SFT is often not possible, and hence the collateral allocation may not be known.
