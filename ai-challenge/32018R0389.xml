The authentication procedure should include, in general, transaction monitoring mechanisms to detect attempts to use a payment service user's personalised security credentials that were lost, stolen, or misappropriated and should also ensure that the payment service user is the legitimate user and therefore is giving consent for the transfer of funds and access to its account information through a normal use of the personalised security credentials. Furthermore, it is necessary to specify the requirements of the strong customer authentication that should be applied each time a payer accesses its payment account online, initiates an electronic payment transaction or carries out any action through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuse, by requiring the generation of an authentication code which should be resistant against the risk of being forged in its entirety or by disclosure of any of the elements upon which the code was generated.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(2)</NO.P><TXT>As fraud methods are constantly changing, the requirements of strong customer authentication should allow for innovation in the technical solutions addressing the emergence of new threats to the security of electronic payments. To ensure that the requirements to be laid down are effectively implemented on a continuous basis, it is also appropriate to require that the security measures for the application of strong customer authentication and its exemptions, the measures to protect confidentiality and integrity of the personalised security credentials, and the measures establishing common and secure open standards of communication are documented, periodically tested, evaluated and audited by auditors with expertise in IT security and payments and operationally independent.

This leaves aside that in accordance with Articles 65, 66 and 67 Directive (EU) 2015/2366, payment initiation service providers, payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments and account information service providers should only seek and obtain the necessary and essential information from the account servicing payment service provider for the provision of a given payment service with the consent of the payment service user.

In line with those principles, thresholds below which no strong customer authentication needs to be applied should be set in a prudent manner, to cover only online purchases of low value. The thresholds for online purchases should be set more prudently, considering that the fact that the person is not physically present when making the purchase is posing a slightly higher security risk.</TXT></NP></CONSID><?PAGE NO="25"?><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(13)</NO.P><TXT>The requirements of strong customer authentication apply to payments initiated by the payer, regardless of whether the payer is a natural person or a legal entity.

Where the competent authorities establish that those payment processes and protocols that are only made available to payers who are not consumers achieve the objectives of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 in terms of security, payment service providers may, in relation to those processes or protocols, be exempted from the strong customer authentication requirements.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(14)</NO.P><TXT>In the case of real-time transaction risk analysis that categorise a payment transaction as low risk, it is also appropriate to introduce an exemption for the payment service provider that intends not to apply strong customer authentication through the adoption of effective and risk-based requirements which ensure the safety of the payment service user's funds and personal data. Those risk-based requirements should combine the scores of the risk analysis, confirming that no abnormal spending or behavioural pattern of the payer has been identified, taking into account other risk factors including information on the location of the payer and of the payee with monetary thresholds based on fraud rates calculated for remote payments. Where, on the basis of the real-time transaction risk analysis, a payment cannot be qualified as posing a low level of risk, the payment service provider should revert to strong customer authentication. The maximum value of such risk-based exemption should be set in a manner ensuring a very low corresponding fraud rate, also by comparison to the fraud rates of all the payment transactions of the payment service provider, including those authenticated through strong customer authentication, within a certain period of time and on a rolling basis.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(15)</NO.P><TXT>For the purpose of ensuring an effective enforcement, payment service providers that wish to benefit from the exemptions from strong customer authentication should regularly monitor and make available to competent authorities and to the European Banking Authority (EBA), upon their request, for each payment transaction type, the value of fraudulent or unauthorised payment transactions and the observed fraud rates for all their payment transactions, whether authenticated through strong customer authentication or executed under a relevant exemption.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(16)</NO.P><TXT>The collection of this new historical evidence on the fraud rates of electronic payment transactions will also contribute to an effective review by the EBA of the thresholds for an exemption to strong customer authentication based on a real-time transaction risk analysis. The EBA should review and submit draft updates to the Commission of these regulatory technical standards, where appropriate, by submitting new draft thresholds and corresponding fraud rates with the aim of enhancing the security of remote electronic payments, in accordance with Article 98(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<NOTE NOTE.ID="E0002" NUMBERING="ARAB" TYPE="FOOTNOTE"><P>Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of <DATE ISO="20101124">24 November 2010</DATE> establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC (<REF.DOC.OJ COLL="L" DATE.PUB="20101215" NO.OJ="331" PAGE.FIRST="12">OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12</REF.DOC.OJ>).</P></NOTE>.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(17)</NO.P><TXT>Payment service providers that make use of any of the exemptions to be provided for should be allowed at any time to choose to apply strong customer authentication to the actions and to the payment transactions referred to in those provisions.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(18)</NO.P><TXT>The measures that protect the confidentiality and integrity of personalised security credentials, as well as authentication devices and software, should limit the risks relating to fraud through unauthorised or fraudulent use of payment instruments and unauthorised access to payment accounts. To this end it is necessary to introduce requirements on the secure creation and delivery of the personalised security credentials and their association with the payment service user, and to provide conditions for the renewal and deactivation of those credentials.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(19)</NO.P><TXT>In order to ensure effective and secure communication between the relevant actors in the context of account information services, payment initiation services and confirmation on the availabilty of funds, it is necessary to specify the requirements of common and secure open standards of communication to be met by all relevant payment service providers. Directive (EU) 2015/2366 provides for the access and use of payment account information by account information service providers. This regulation therefore does not change the rules of access to accounts other than payment accounts.</TXT></NP></CONSID><?PAGE NO="26"?><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(20)</NO.P><TXT>Each account servicing payment service provider with payment accounts that are accessible online should offer at least one access interface enabling secure communication with account information service providers, payment initiation service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments. The interface should enable the account information service providers, payment initiation service providers and payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments to identify themselves to the account servicing payment service provider.
