The revocation of the authorisation should not be automatically triggered by a fall of the assets under management of an authorised AIFM below the relevant threshold, but only at the request of the AIFM. Consequently it should not be possible for an AIFM to request to opt in as long as it holds an authorisation<?PAGE NO='2'?> under Directive 2011/61/EU, whereas an AIFM whose authorisation has been revoked upon its request should still be able to seek to opt in again under Directive 2011/61/EU.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>Directive 2011/61/EU obliges Member States to apply the laws, regulations and administrative provisions which transpose that Directive from <DATE ISO="20130722">22 July 2013</DATE>.
