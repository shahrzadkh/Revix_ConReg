With regard to existing CCPs established in third countries that have already applied for recognition, for the time being no recognition has been granted yet to such CCPs. A further extension of the transitional period will therefore enable institutions established in the Union (or their subsidiaries established outside the Union) to avoid significant increase in the own funds requirements due to the lack of recognised CCPs established in each of those relevant third countries and providing, in a viable and accessible way, the specific type of clearing services that those Union institutions require. While such an increase may only be temporary, it could potentially lead to their withdrawal as direct participants in those CCPs and hence cause disruption in the markets in which those CCPs operate. An additional six-month extension of the transitional periods, i.e. until <DATE ISO="20150615">15 June 2015</DATE>, is therefore necessary.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Banking Committee</TXT></NP></CONSID></GR.CONSID><?PAGE NO="7"?><PREAMBLE.FINAL>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</PREAMBLE.FINAL></PREAMBLE><ENACTING.TERMS><ARTICLE IDENTIFIER="001"><TI.ART>Article 1</TI.ART><ALINEA>The 15-month periods referred to in Article 497(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in the first and second subparagraph of Article 89(5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, respectively, as already extended pursuant to Article 1 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 591/2014, are extended by an additional 6 months.</ALINEA></ARTICLE><ARTICLE IDENTIFIER="002"><TI.ART>Article 2</TI.ART><ALINEA>This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the <HT TYPE="ITALIC">Official Journal of the European Union</HT>.</ALINEA></ARTICLE></ENACTING.TERMS><FINAL><P>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</P><SIGNATURE><PL.DATE><P>Done at Brussels, <DATE ISO="20141211">11 December 2014</DATE>.</P></PL.DATE><SIGNATORY><P><HT TYPE="ITALIC">For the Commission</HT></P><P><HT TYPE="ITALIC">The President</HT></P><P>Jean-Claude <HT TYPE="UC">Juncker</HT></P></SIGNATORY></SIGNATURE></FINAL></ACT>
