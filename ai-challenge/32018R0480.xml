This is the case, in particular, where a financial derivative instrument to hedge an exposure to a specific item is not available as a dedicated type of derivative, but rather as an item among other items included in an index which is the underlying of a financial derivative instrument. In addition, the use of financial derivative instruments might in some cases constitute a hedging strategy only if it is pursued in combination with trades in some assets, whereby that type of strategy should not be prohibited. In order to ensure that the use of financial derivative instruments solely serves the purpose of hedging the risks inherent to the investments of an ELTIF, the manager of the ELTIF should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the financial derivative instruments used effectively reduce the relevant risk at the ELTIF level and are also efficient in stressed market conditions. The reduction of risk should be verifiable through the use of adequate risk management systems identifying the risk intended to be mitigated and the way in which the derivative would mitigate such risk.</TXT></NP></CONSID><?PAGE NO="2"?><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(4)</NO.P><TXT>In situations where an ELTIF invests in assets that have different maturity profiles, the life of an ELTIF should be set with reference to the individual asset within the ELTIF portfolio which has the longest investment horizon having regard to the liquidity of that asset.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(5)</NO.P><TXT>The assessment of the market for potential buyers to be included in the schedule for the orderly disposal of the ELTIF assets should take into account market risks including whether the potential buyers are typically dependent on obtaining loans from third parties, whether there is a risk of illiquidity of the assets before sale, whether there are risks associated with legislative changes, such as fiscal reforms, or political changes and whether there is a risk of deterioration of the economic situation in the market which is relevant to the ELTIF assets.
