Consequently, most intermediaries carrying out insurance intermediation, and their insurers, are familiar with that approach and therefore it is appropriate to establish a similar system for credit intermediaries. Further, the majority of Member States whose national laws require professional indemnity insurance by credit intermediaries also use such an approach. Therefore, rules on PII for credit intermediaries should also propose such a per-year-and-per-claim distinction.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(7)</NO.P><TXT>The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<NOTE NOTE.ID="E0003" NUMBERING="ARAB" TYPE="FOOTNOTE"><P>Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of <DATE ISO="20101124">24 November 2010</DATE> establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC (<REF.DOC.OJ COLL="L" DATE.PUB="20101215" NO.OJ="331" PAGE.FIRST="12">OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12</REF.DOC.OJ>).</P></NOTE>,</TXT></NP></CONSID></GR.CONSID><PREAMBLE.FINAL>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</PREAMBLE.FINAL></PREAMBLE><ENACTING.TERMS><ARTICLE IDENTIFIER="001"><TI.ART>Article 1</TI.ART><ALINEA><P>The minimum monetary amount of the professional indemnity insurance or comparable guarantee required to be held by credit intermediaries as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 29(2)(a) of Directive 2014/17/EU shall be:</P><LIST TYPE="alpha"><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(a)</NO.P><TXT>EUR <FT TYPE="NUMBER">460000</FT> for each individual claim;</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(b)</NO.P><TXT>in aggregate, EUR <FT TYPE="NUMBER">750000</FT> per calendar year for all claims.</TXT></NP></ITEM></LIST></ALINEA></ARTICLE><ARTICLE IDENTIFIER="002"><TI.ART>Article 2</TI.ART><ALINEA>This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <HT TYPE="ITALIC">Official Journal of the European Union</HT>.</ALINEA></ARTICLE></ENACTING.TERMS><FINAL><P>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</P><SIGNATURE><PL.DATE><P>Done at Brussels, <DATE ISO="20140919">19 September 2014</DATE>.</P></PL.DATE><SIGNATORY><P><HT TYPE="ITALIC">For the Commission</HT></P><P><HT TYPE="ITALIC">The President</HT></P><P>José Manuel <HT TYPE="UC">Barroso</HT></P></SIGNATORY></SIGNATURE></FINAL></ACT>
