This results from the fact that if a default event has occurred for an underlying asset, losses are always distributed amongst the exposures that rank <HT TYPE="ITALIC">pari passu</HT> according to the pro-rata ratio of each of these exposures and the maximum loss to be suffered by the institution in case of a total loss on an underlying asset is limited to the portion according to the ratio of the institution’s exposure to the total of all the exposures that rank <HT TYPE="ITALIC">pari passu</HT>.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>A distinction should be made between transactions where all investors rank <HT TYPE="ITALIC">pari passu</HT> such as collective investment undertakings, and other transactions, such as securitisations, which can involve tranching where exposures can rank differently in seniority. For the former, the resulting exposure to an underlying asset is solely dependent on the pro-rata ratio of the investor’s exposure in relation to the exposures of all investors. For the latter, losses are attributed first to certain tranches depending on their seniority and then, in case of more than one investor into the same tranche, amongst the investors on a pro rata basis. All tranches in a securitisation should be treated equally as, in a worst case scenario, subordinated tranches may disappear very quickly. In particular, the maximum loss to be suffered by all investors in a certain tranche in case of a total loss on an underlying asset should be recognised since no mitigation should be recognised from subordinated tranches. The institution’s exposure to an underlying asset of a transaction should not exceed the total exposure value of this tranche (since the loss for an investor in a given tranche that stems from the default of an underlying asset can never be higher than the total exposure value of the tranche) and the exposure value of the exposure formed by the underlying asset (since the institution can never lose more than the amount of the underlying asset). This limitation of maximum loss should<?PAGE NO='2'?> be reflected by using the lower of the two exposure values and then applying the procedure for recognising the pro-rata distribution of losses amongst all exposures that rank <HT TYPE="ITALIC">pari passu</HT> in this tranche, in case of more than one investor in this tranche.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(4)</NO.P><TXT>Although institutions are expected to identify all obligors of underlying assets of transactions in which they invest, there may be cases where this would create unjustifiable costs for institutions or where circumstances prevent institutions from identifying particular obligors As such, where an exposure to an underlying asset is sufficiently small to only immaterially contribute to the overall exposure to a certain client or group of connected clients, it should be sufficient to assign this exposure to the transaction as a separate client. The total of such exposures to underlying assets of the same transaction should then still be limited by the large exposures limit for this transaction. Immateriality of the contribution of an underlying asset to the overall exposure should be assumed where at least 100 exposures to underlying assets of a transaction are needed to reach the limit of 25 % of the institution’s eligible capital. This would require that the exposure value does not exceed 0,25 % of the institution’s eligible capital.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(5)</NO.P><TXT>In order to prevent an unlimited overall exposure resulting from information deficiencies, it would be necessary to assign exposures — for which the exposure value exceeds 0,25 % of the institution’s eligible capital and for which information on the obligor is missing — to a hypothetical client (unknown client) to which the 25 % large exposures’ limit should apply.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>Where an institution is not able to distinguish between the underlying assets of a transaction in terms of their amount, there is a risk that the underlying assets of the transaction relate to the same obligor or group of connected clients.
