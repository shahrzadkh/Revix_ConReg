Specific requirements should therefore be set for different classes of instruments to ensure that they are appropriate to be used for the purposes of variable remuneration, taking account of the different nature of the instruments. The use of instruments for the purposes of variable remuneration should not in itself prevent instruments from qualifying as own funds of an institution as long as the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 are met.

As the economic outcome of a conversion or write-down of Other Instruments is the same as for Additional Tier 1 instruments, write-down or conversion mechanisms for Other Instruments should take into account the mechanisms that apply to Additional Tier 1 instruments, with adaptations to take account of the fact that Other Instruments do not qualify as own fund instruments from a prudential perspective. Tier 2 instruments are not subject to regulatory requirements regarding write-down and conversion under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. To ensure that the value of all such instruments, when used for variable remuneration, is reduced when the credit quality of the institution deteriorates, the situations in which a write-down or conversion of the instrument is necessary should be specified.

Staff members should only receive distributions in respect of periods which follow the vesting of the instrument. Therefore only instruments with distributions which are paid periodically to the owner of the instrument are appropriate for use as variable remuneration; zero coupon bonds or instruments which retain earnings should not count towards the substantial portion of remuneration which must consist of a balance of the instruments referred to in point (l) of Article 94(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU. This is because staff would benefit during the deferral period from increasing values, which can be understood as equivalent to receiving distributions.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(9)</NO.P><TXT>Very high distributions can reduce the long-term incentive for prudent risk-taking as they effectively increase the variable part of the remuneration. In particular distributions should not be paid out at intervals of longer than one year, as this would lead to distributions effectively accumulating during deferral periods and being paid out once the variable remuneration vests. Accumulation of distributions would circumvent point (g) of Article 94(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU regarding the ratio between variable and fixed components of remuneration and the principle in point (m) of that Article that remuneration payable under deferral arrangements vests no faster than on a pro rata basis. Therefore distributions made after the instrument has vested should not exceed market rates. This should be ensured by requiring instruments used for variable remuneration, or the instruments to which they are linked, to be issued mainly to other investors, or by requiring such instruments to be subject to a cap on distributions.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(10)</NO.P><TXT>Deferral and retention requirements which apply to awards of variable remuneration pursuant to Article 94(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU have to be met at all relevant times, including when instruments used for variable remuneration are called, redeemed, repurchased or converted.

It should be possible to use synthetic instruments or contracts between staff members and institutions which are linked to Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments which can be fully converted or written down.

Institutions within such a group may not, therefore, always issue instruments which are appropriate to be used for the purpose of variable remuneration. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 enables Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through an entity within the scope of consolidation to form part of an institution's own funds subject to certain conditions. Therefore it should also be possible to use such instruments for the purpose of variable remuneration, provided that there is a clear link between the credit quality of the institution using these instruments for the purpose of variable remuneration and the credit quality of the issuer of the instrument. Such a link can usually be assumed to be the case between a parent undertaking and a subsidiary. Instruments other than Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments which are not issued directly by an institution should also be capable of being used for variable remuneration, subject to equivalent conditions. Instruments which are linked to reference instruments issued by parent undertakings in third countries and which are equivalent to Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments should be eligible to be used for the purposes of variable remuneration if the trigger event refers to the institution using such a synthetic instrument.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(13)</NO.P><TXT>This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to the European Commission.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(14)</NO.P><TXT>EBA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<NOTE NOTE.ID="E0004" NUMBERING="ARAB" TYPE="FOOTNOTE"><P>Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of <DATE ISO="20101124">24 November 2010</DATE> establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC (<REF.DOC.OJ COLL="L" DATE.PUB="20101215" NO.OJ="331" PAGE.FIRST="12">OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12</REF.DOC.OJ>).</P></NOTE>,</TXT></NP></CONSID></GR.CONSID><PREAMBLE.FINAL>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</PREAMBLE.FINAL></PREAMBLE><ENACTING.TERMS><ARTICLE IDENTIFIER="001"><TI.ART>Article 1</TI.ART><STI.ART>Classes of instruments that adequately reflect the credit quality of an institution as a going concern and are appropriate to be used for the purposes of variable remuneration</STI.ART><PARAG IDENTIFIER="001.001"><NO.PARAG>1.</NO.PARAG><ALINEA><P>The following shall be the classes of instruments that satisfy the conditions laid down in point (l)(ii) of Article 94(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU:</P><LIST TYPE="alpha"><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(a)</NO.P><TXT>classes of Additional Tier 1 instruments where those classes fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 and Article 2, and comply with Article 5(9) and point (c) of Article 5(13);</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(b)</NO.P><TXT>classes of Tier 2 instruments where those classes fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 and Article 3, and comply with Article 5;</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(c)</NO.P><TXT>classes of instruments which can be fully converted to Common Equity Tier 1 instruments or written down and which are neither Additional Tier 1 instruments nor Tier 2 instruments (<QUOT.START CODE="2018" ID="QS0001" REF.END="QE0001" />Other Instruments<QUOT.END CODE="2019" ID="QE0001" REF.START="QS0001" />) in the cases referred to in Article 4 where those classes fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 and comply with Article 5.</TXT></NP></ITEM></LIST></ALINEA></PARAG><?PAGE NO="24"?><PARAG IDENTIFIER="001.002"><NO.PARAG>2.</NO.PARAG><ALINEA><P>The classes of instruments referred to in paragraph 1 shall fulfil the following conditions:</P><LIST TYPE="alpha"><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(a)</NO.P><TXT>instruments shall not be secured or subject to a guarantee that enhances the seniority of the claims of the holder;</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(b)</NO.P><TXT>where the provisions governing an instrument allow its conversion, that instrument shall only be used for the purposes of awarding variable remuneration where the rate or range of conversion is set at a level that ensures that the value of the instrument into which the instrument initially awarded is converted is not higher than the value of the instrument initially awarded at the time it was awarded as variable remuneration;</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(c)</NO.P><TXT>the provisions governing convertible instruments which are used for the sole purpose of variable remuneration shall ensure that the value of the instrument into which the instrument initially awarded is converted is not higher than the value, at the time of that conversion, of the instrument initially awarded;</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(d)</NO.P><TXT>the provisions governing the instrument shall provide that any distributions are paid on at least an annual basis and are paid to the holder of the instrument;</TXT></NP></ITEM><ITEM><NP><NO.P>(e)</NO.P><TXT>instruments shall be priced at their value at the time the instrument is awarded, in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.
