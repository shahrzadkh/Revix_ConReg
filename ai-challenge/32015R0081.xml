The risk-adjusted contribution is based on the criteria laid down in Article 103(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU. According to the third subparagraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the use of the Fund is contingent upon the entry into force of the Agreement.

Moreover, a system temporarily founded on compartments might globally influence the relative importance of institutions to the stability of the financial system or economy, as referred to in point (g) of Article 103(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU. The importance of the institutions to the stability of the financial system or economy should be determined in relation to, respectively, the Member State where the institution is located (i.e., the expected loss for the part of the compartment not yet mutualised) and the Banking union as a whole (i.e., the expected loss for the part of the compartment mutualised).

The method for calculating contributions should thus be adjusted in a manner such that it correlates to the rhythm of mutualisation of the Fund.

It is therefore convenient to introduce a simplified calculation of the contributions to be paid by those institutions. This would also prevent possible short-term changes in the status that these institutions might undertake in order to qualify for the application of Article 10 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/63. That calculation should include a component based on a lump sum. This system should avoid distortions between institutions and achieve a balanced distribution of contributions between the different types of institutions.
