As part of the appropriate arrangements, disclosing market participants should establish procedures describing the manner in which market soundings are conducted.

Therefore, where the market soundings are conducted by telephone and the disclosing market participant has access to recorded telephone lines, the disclosing market participant should use those lines. Where market soundings are conducted through channels other than by recorded telephone lines, records of the market sounding communications should be kept in the form of audio or video recordings or in written form.

In this respect, the disclosing market participant should be considered to be acting within the normal course of employment, profession or duties only in so far as it complies with all requirements, including record-keeping requirements set out in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 and this Regulation.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(6)</NO.P><TXT>Given that an assessment of what constitutes inside information, undertaken in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, can be complex, disclosing market participants should keep records of all market soundings, including the ones that are considered by the disclosing market participant not to involve disclosure<?PAGE NO="30"?> of inside information.
