Therefore there is potential for significant impact in either one or more Member States or at Union level. Similarly, there is potential for significant adverse impact with regard to only one or more of the criteria referred to in Article 20(1)(c)(iii) It is therefore important to conduct the assessment both at national or market level as well as at Union level.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 lists five areas where significant adverse impacts might arise. While market integrity focuses on the market for a specific financial product, financial stability refers to the financial system of a Member State or the Union as a whole. Consumers are primarily impacted through the financial instruments and investment funds, including pension funds, they have invested in and the financial contracts they have signed which reference the critical benchmark in question. The potential impact on the real economy is directly related to the value of financial instruments, financial contracts and investment funds that reference that benchmark. The potential impact on the financing of households and businesses is likely to increase with the value of outstanding loans relative to the size of the economy. Consumers and the financing of households and businesses are more vulnerable to adverse impacts where the overall level of indebtedness of households and businesses is high,</TXT></NP></CONSID></GR.CONSID><PREAMBLE.FINAL>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</PREAMBLE.FINAL></PREAMBLE><ENACTING.TERMS><ARTICLE IDENTIFIER="001"><TI.ART>Article 1</TI.ART><STI.ART>Assessment by
