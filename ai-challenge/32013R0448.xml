In those cases the non-EU AIFM has to submit a request to the competent authorities of those Member States to determine its Member State of reference. The request should be accompanied by all the relevant information and documentation necessary for determining the Member State of reference for this AIFM. A joint decision should be adopted by the competent authorities concerned to determine the Member State of reference. A procedure to be followed by the relevant competent authorities when determining the Member State of reference needs to be established.
