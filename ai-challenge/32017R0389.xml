The value of the financial instruments underlying the transaction should also be the basis for the calculation of the level of cash penalty where the settlement fail is due to a lack of cash. The level of cash penalties should provide incentives to failing participants to promptly settle transactions that failed to be settled.

Where shares have a liquid market and could therefore be bought easily, settlement fails should be subject to the highest penalty rate in order to provide incentives to failing participants to settle failed transactions in a timely manner.

They are also often traded over-the-counter (OTC). In view of the limited volume and size of transactions and in order to reflect their non-standardised trading and settlement, settlement fails should be subject to a similar penalty rate to the one for shares that do not have a liquid market.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(11)</NO.P><TXT>The parameters for calculating cash penalties should be adapted to the specificities of certain trading venues, such as SME growth markets as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<NOTE NOTE.ID="E0002" NUMBERING="ARAB" TYPE="FOOTNOTE"><P>Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of <DATE ISO="20140515">15 May 2014</DATE> on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (<REF.DOC.OJ COLL="L" DATE.PUB="20140612" NO.OJ="173" PAGE.FIRST="349">OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349</REF.DOC.OJ>).</P></NOTE>. Cash penalties for settlement fails should not hinder access by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to capital markets as an alternative to bank lending. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 allows SME growth markets the flexibility not to apply the buy-in process to settlement fails until up to 15 days after the intended settlement date. Consequently, cash penalties for settlement fails in financial instruments traded on SME growth markets may apply during a longer period of time than for other financial instruments. Given the length of application of cash penalties, lower liquidity and specificities of SME growth markets, the penalty rate for settlement fails of transactions in financial instruments traded on such trading venues should be set at a specific rate that should provide incentives for timely settlement but should not affect their smooth and orderly functioning. It is also appropriate to ensure that settlement fails of transactions in certain financial instruments, such as debt instruments traded on such venues, are subject to a lower penalty rate than similar debt instruments traded on other markets.</TXT></NP></CONSID><?PAGE NO="3"?><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(12)</NO.P><TXT>Settlement fails due to a lack of cash should be subject to a single penalty rate for all transactions given that such a situation is independent from the asset type and liquidity of the financial instrument concerned or the type of transaction. In order to ensure a deterrent effect and incentivise timely settlement by failing participants through cash borrowing, it is appropriate to use the costs of borrowing cash as a basis for the penalty rate. The most appropriate penalty rate should be the official interest rate of the central bank issuing the settlement currency that should evidence the borrowing costs for that currency.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(13)</NO.P><TXT>Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 allows CSDs to provide their services in the Union under the supervision of competent authorities of their home Member States.
