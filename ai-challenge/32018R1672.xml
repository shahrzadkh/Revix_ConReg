Given their characteristics, certain bearer-negotiable instruments, commodities used as highly-liquid stores of value, and prepaid cards which are not linked to a bank account and which can store an amount of money which is difficult to detect are likely to be used in place of currency as an anonymous means of transferring value across the external borders in a manner that is not traceable using the classic system of supervision by the public authorities.
