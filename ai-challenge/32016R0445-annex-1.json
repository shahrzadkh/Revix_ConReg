In addition, they must take into account whether there are any current or anticipated material practical or legal impediments that would hinder the timely repayment of the exposure by the counterparty to the credit institution, other than in the event of a recovery or resolution situation when the restrictions outlined in Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the CouncilDirective 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 190). are required to be implemented;</li>\n<li>the proposed intragroup exposures are justified by the group's funding structure;</li>\n<li>the process by which a decision is made to approve an exposure to the intragroup counterparty, and the monitoring and review process applicable to such exposures, at individual level and at consolidated level, where relevant, are similar to those that are applied to third party lending;</li>\n<li>the credit institution's risk management procedures, IT system and internal reporting enable it to continuously check and ensure that large exposures to group undertakings are aligned with its risk strategy at legal entity level and at consolidated level, where relevant.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>For the purpose of assessing whether any remaining concentration risk can be addressed by other equally effective means such as the arrangements, processes and mechanisms provided for in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU, as provided for in Article 400(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, credit institutions must take into account whether:<ol class=\"crrRomanList\">\n<li>the credit institution has robust processes, procedures and controls, at individual level and at consolidated level, where relevant, to ensure that use of the exemption would not result in concentration risk that is outside its risk strategy and against the principles of sound internal liquidity management within the group;</li>\n<li>the credit institution has formally considered the concentration risk arising from intragroup exposures as part of its overall risk assessment framework;</li>\n<li>the credit institution has a risk control framework, at legal entity level and at consolidated level where relevant, that adequately monitors the proposed exposures;</li>\n<li>the concentration risk arising has been or will be clearly identified in the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) of the credit institution and will be actively managed.
