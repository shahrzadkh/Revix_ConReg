The description of the investment policy should indicate to the investor what the overall aims of the UCITS are and how these objectives are to be achieved.

In applying the rules on the synthetic indicator account should be taken of the methodology for the calculation of the synthetic indicator as developed by competent authorities working within the Committee of European Securities Regulators. The management company should decide on a case-by-case basis which specific risks should be disclosed by analysing the particular characteristics of each fund, bearing in mind the need to avoid over-burdening the document with information that retail investors will find difficult to understand.

This Regulation supplements the rules of Directive 2004/39/EC by including specific requirements necessary for harmonising the information for the purpose of facilitating comparisons between different key investor information documents.

Consequently, this Regulation tailors the general rules applicable to all UCITS so as to take into account the specific situation of certain types of UCITS, namely those having different investment compartments or share classes, those with fund of funds structures, those with master-feeder structures, and those that are structured, such as capital protected or comparable UCITS.</TXT></NP></CONSID><?PAGE NO="3"?><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(13)</NO.P><TXT>With regard to UCITS having different share classes, there should be no obligation to produce a separate key investor information document for every such share class, so long as investors’ interests are not compromised. The details of two or more classes may be combined into a single key investor information document only where this can be done without making the document too complicated or crowded. Alternatively, a representative class may be selected, but only in cases where there is sufficient similarity between the classes such that information about the representative class is fair, clear and not misleading as regards the represented class. In determining whether the use of a representative class is fair, clear and not misleading, regard should be had to the characteristics of the UCITS, the nature of the differences represented by each class, and the range of choices on offer to each investor or group of investors.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(14)</NO.P><TXT>In the case of a fund of funds, the right balance is kept between the information on the UCITS that the investor invests in and its underlying collectives. The key investor information document of a fund of funds should therefore be prepared on the basis that the investor does not wish or need to be informed in detail about the individual features of each of the underlying collectives, which in any case are likely to vary from time to time if the UCITS is being actively managed. However, in order for the key investor information document to deliver effective disclosure of the fund of funds’ objective and investment policy, risk factors, and charging structure, the characteristics of its underlying funds should be transparent.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(15)</NO.P><TXT>In the case of master-feeder structures, the description of the feeder UCITS’ risk and reward profile should not be materially different to that of the corresponding section in the master UCITS’ key investor information document so that the feeder can copy information from the key investor information document of the master wherever it is relevant. However, this information should be supplemented by relevant statements or duly adjusted in those cases where ancillary assets held by the feeder might modify the risk profile compared to the master, addressing the risks inherent in these ancillary assets, for instance where derivatives are used. The combined costs of investing in the feeder and the master should be disclosed to investors in the feeder.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(16)</NO.P><TXT>With regard to structured UCITS, such as capital protected and other comparable UCITS, the provision of prospective performance scenarios in place of past performance information is required. Prospective performance scenarios involve calculating the expected return of the fund under favourable, adverse, or neutral hypotheses regarding market conditions.
