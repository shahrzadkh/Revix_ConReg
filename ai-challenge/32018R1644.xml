One of those conditions is that an equivalence decision has been adopted recognising the legal framework and supervisory practices of the third country as equivalent.

It is therefore important that each set of cooperation arrangements contains the same minimum requirements regarding the forms and procedures to be used for the exchange of information, including the same confidentiality provisions and the same terms governing the use of information obtained under the cooperation arrangements.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>Competent authorities of third countries whose legal framework and supervisory practices have been recognised as equivalent will have adequate knowledge of all relevant events and changes of circumstance likely to affect benchmark administrators in their jurisdiction.
