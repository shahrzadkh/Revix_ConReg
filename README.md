# Revix_ConReg
This is a repository for codes used in the implementation of CogReg, a topic modelling App for legal acts. 
## Data Analysis:
### Text Preprocessing:
- Performed using **NLTK** and **sklearn** within python. 
### Topic modelling:
- performed using **Genism**, but functions for creating Feature vectors and performing subsequent topic modelling in **Sklearn** is also provided in the notebook. 
### Visualization: 
- _Word cloud_
- _Topic distance map_ using **pyLDAvis**
- Network of **_Topic to Article_** Connections using **NetwrkX**, **Bokeh**, and **Holoviews**
** **
_See "Copy_of_Topic_modelling_with_Genism_for_Binder_final.ipynb" for final version of the used code and also all additional functions for generating the topic modelling in sklearn and Genism using both LDA and LSI._
** **

## User Interface: 
- Generated with **Anvil**

_Source code of the Anvil app: ConRegReViX.yaml_
